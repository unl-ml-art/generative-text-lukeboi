To me it's yet another example of the stupidity and harm caused by the anti-nuclear movement. The decades of campaigning against nuclear power resulting in a shortage of power that forces people to destroy more native habitat in order to import electricity hundreds of miles. Surely you realize that transmission lines have ENORMOUS losses. All of them do. It is never efficient to transmit power hundreds or thousands of miles. You wind up losing 2/3 of it through transmission losses. It's not like piping oil or water across country. It is most efficient to generate it close to the place where it is going to be consumed. The problem is the lack of *local* generation capacity, NOT the inability to erect massive transmission lines to get it from Quebec to New York.\n",

My elderly relative way down here has two of them, one for each of her two houses. They have become standard features in expensive new homes. I've been through several hurricanes in the low country, in a place where mandatory evacuations are the rule when a hurricane is approaching. Like with mandatory masking, many residents ignore the mandatory evacuation order. What the local government or authorities do is shut off power, both to avoid fires (falling trees splitting power lines) and to encourage residents to leave. Of course, whole house generators serve as a disincentive to evacuate. Why would people stay? Because residents, once they leave, aren't allowed to return for days if not weeks, the national guard, armed, enforcing the no return policy. Not to be outsmarted, the local government or authorities have resorted to turning off (or threatening to turn off) the water supply to the area subject to the mandatory evacuation order.

But that other research didn't compare their RNA editing rates to mammals', and did claim that the evolutionary cost of all this RNA editing was that the genes for it needed to be protected, resulting in slower rates of DNA mutation among these cephalopods. But this latest article says that vertebrates have similarly high rates of RNA editing, or at least of microRNA \"expansion\", and doesn't mention low DNA mutation rates.

      "#2: a list of things about the Emerald Isle that should already really be widely known (but a good reference if not!). \"GDP has become a hopelessly inadequate guide to the health of the Irish economy. Nor is GNI reliable, largely as a result of the capital assets owned by multinationals located in Ireland, which carry with them large depreciation charges. That is why Figure 2 was calculated using what Irish national accountants call GNI*, which corrects for these distortions. Strikingly, Irish GNI* growth since 2000 has averaged just 0.7% per annum.\" Flat growth is ever so European (including post 2008 Britain of course). \"When measured in terms of consumption, it would rank even lower. In particular, it would rank below the UK, with total household consumption (including consumption of government-provided services) roughly on a par with consumption in Northern Ireland (FitzGerald and Morgenroth 2020, see also Bergin and McGuinness 2021). In terms of living standards and growth, Ireland is thus a rather run-of-the-mill European economy.\" You could add in that hours worked per year is relatively high in Ireland - https://clockify.me/working-hours (Working week is not long though, so it appears to be limited holiday). Like Singapore, on consumption/hour worked measures we diverge sharply from GDP ranking. \"(L)ow corporate tax rates also helped; Ireland got away with the latter because of the long-standing nature of the policy, the country’s peripherality and relative economic backwardness, and its small size. But the extent of tax avoidance globally now means that international corporate tax reforms are both inevitable and desirable. If Ireland were merely a home for brass-plate, profit-shifting enterprises it would have little to fear from this, but multinationals are major employers in the country, and the taxes they pay are a major source of government revenue. The hope will be that the country’s other advantages will suffice to maintain its attractiveness to domestic and foreign investors as it adjusts to Brexit.\"\n",

      "\"America is in danger because, among other things, 'the vast majority of our spooks spend their days analyzing their identities along intersectional lines of race, gender and sexuality'...\" If it only resulted in new forms of navel-gazing, woke CIA employees would be irritating at worst. A more interesting question is whether the same race-gender-sexuality ideas also shape their understanding of who the enemy is, what he (bound to be a he) is like, etc. This may have quite far-reaching implications; former allies may start to look like arch-foes, and vice versa. \"[this] presupposes a level of competence in the pre-woke CIA that is far beyond what it deserves given the historical record\" I agree that the CIA was probably far more incompetent than countless movies would have us know. It was not so incompetent that it could not do a lot of damage, though. If wokeness changes the organization's understanding of who the enemy is, etc, this dangerous incompetence is likely to be directed at new groups. \"In the future imagined by Ahmari, the Ameri­can military is ill-prepared to execute its mission, having been busy naming and renaming bases.\" I guess it does not really matter whether the missile that kills me and my family has an American flag or a rainbow flag painted on it. The flag on the missile may well give clues about why I was killed, though. Other than that, I also think wokeness in the military is bound to create recruitment problems etc. If the group that historically provided most of the soldiers in the units that did most of the fighting is habitually portrayed as toxic white supremacists, chances are they won't keep on doing your fighting for you. That may be a good thing.\n",

Traditional religions have zero to do with explaining the outside world. How could they? They were born in a time that predated man's fixation on the outside world. Instead, they have everything to do with discussing the subjective experience of the world inside your head and how it relates to your social world--both of which existed in full force at the time of their founding. They are narrative-based precursors to phenomenology and sociology. Nothing more. As a result, intellectual paths like the one Hanson describes sound peculiar. They start at a point that misstates what religion is and end up at a point of rejecting religion. Of course, religious people often make wild claims about the outside world, using religion to justify them. With religion as with any system of thought, however, you want to separate the claims of adherents from the underlying thought.\n",

If so, after reading his post, I'm still not sure why he finds it likely (?) that we could be living in a simulation created by mortals but not a simulation created by a supreme being? I find questions about whether God exists off the mark. Instead, I think it's more salient to distinguish between falsifiable claims and unfalsifiable ones. Falsifiable claims like, \"Prayer reduces the probability of airplanes crashing,\" fall within the domain of science. Unfalsifiable claims like, \"God answers our prayers in ways that could be mysterious to us and that we may not fully understand at first, if ever,\" fall outside the domain of, and hence cannot be rejected by, science. By definition, faith is the acceptance (or rejection) of claims that are unfalsifiable and unprovable. That's probably the real reason why other physicists reach different conclusions from Hanson about the existence of God. One could even view science as the study of falsifiable claims about how a God-created universe (or simulation) operates. To be clear, regardless of one's faith with respect to unfalsifiable claims, it's imperative to not allow such faith to impede one's scientific judgement with respect to falsifiable claims. Even if one accepts on faith that we are living in a simulation, science has delivered much knowledge about constraints on what can and can't happen within that simulation.\n",

The primary reason I am an atheist has nothing to do with philosophical problems like the problem of evil etc. It's that the creator of the universe who chose to leave his mark on the Earth through the Holy Books like the Qu’ran and the Bible which contains *zero* facts about the world that could have never been known by the humans who lived at that time. Or any proof that is incontrovertible and verifiable at any time. I don't need a scientific paper. Just references to currently known facts written in Biblical or Qu’ranical language etc. For example, if there were multiple confidently stated passages in these Holy Books like how all life is coded based on helical structures (i.e. what we now call DNA) I'd probably be religious now. I'd have rightly concluded it's virtually impossible to make such a dead-on guess about the structure of the DNA two thousand years before we discovered it so it has to be the word of God no matter how moral and philosophical claims clash with my own intuitions.

However, public choice theory would suggest (as does my own anecdotal experience as a consultant) that some managers act in their own best interest by attempting to keep a high-performing team to avoid the risk of disruption by changing members.

This would seem to align with the \"it impacts women more\" business, since women are more socially-oriented to begin with. Maybe I just haven't hit that section of the paper yet.\n",

      "In large law firms there is talent hoarding of young lawyers, senior lawyers wanting (and competing for) the best young lawyers to work their cases with them. The flip side is that young lawyers seek (and compete for) assignments from senior lawyers known for producing the best and most interesting work, the glow of the best senior lawyer reflected on the young lawyers working with the senior lawyer. Indeed, a young lawyer's place and potential advancement in a firm is highly dependent on who the young lawyer is assigned to work with. Young female lawyers face a greater challenge than young male lawyers, for both reasons of sexism (not hoarded enough) and reasons of harassment (hoarded too much).\n",

      "I tend to see this more as a symptom of internal reliance on informal training and knowledge, and restrictions on internal bargaining. They're not hoarding talent so much as experience, perhaps? I'm not so sure about the idea of \"When managers rotate to a new position and temporarily stop hoarding talent, workers’ applications for promotions increase by 123%.\". I have often applied for jobs during changes of management, but it was because seeing a manager moving up gave me more incentive to consider my skills adequate for a more senior position, or because the idea of having to temporarily provide extra support to a new manager without being compensated for it was draining. How would you identify that this was due to a change in \"talent hoarding\"? Also what is the mechanism where bosses hoard talent here?

      "I can imagine that this is indeed a problem. I'm not sure that markets can solve it, instead it may be a question of culture. In professional sports, some assistant coaches are very good and are logical candidates to become head coaches -- but that would be a loss for their current team. But with just a few exceptions, the culture seems to be that it is okay for teams to recruit assistant coaches from each other (some leagues seem to require that they ask permission from the current employer), and okay for the assistants to seek jobs with other teams. Occasionally a team will not let their assistant coach go -- unless the new employer hands over a draft pick or some such. But that's rare, rare enough that it's headline news in the sports section when it happens. My supervisor has told me to keep encouraging the professional development of my supervisees; if their skills grow so much that they become good candidates to work somewhere else -- and then they do exactly that because we simply don't have a place to promote them to, we wish them well and count that as a success rather than a loss. At one college that I worked at, distinctly not Harvard University, we lost a professor to Harvard, who hired them away. And a few years later hired another of our profs. We took that as a sign that we had good profs, as well as good fortune for the two profs. But it's easy to understand the incentives to hoard. How to stop it, in a company whose culture does not value providing opportunities for employees to develop and potentially leave, does not seem to be an easy task.\n",

      "BDM has got it somewhat backwards. Having a separate head of religion and head of state is heavily a result of the natural geography of Europe making it hard to have a continent wide empire vs. China. The Holy Roman Empire wished it could have been Europe, including Rome, but it failed miserably. In contrast, not only did the Chinese tend to have very large contiguous states even when broken into warring kingdoms, but the entire imperial examination system and the fact that the elites shared a common written language. This point is not well understood. A written language that was the same, regardless of which Chinese dialect was being spoken, that was hard to learn and mostly impervious to the peasantry meant for much lower administrative costs for the state with barriers to entry from the hoi polloi. In contrast, Latin was never totally dominant and often shared official writing with some local language. In China, having a local written system of laws based on the provincial language was literally impossible for well over a thousand years. So weak states led to weak organized church power as well.\n",

It seems a distinguishing characteristic; thus, one sees nothing remotely similar to “render unto Caesar” in Islam, for example. But by the late medieval and early modern period merchants and merchant-run cities became yet another center of power, along with Princes and Popes. This multiplicity of power-centers in Europe mostly did not exist elsewhere, and thus might have played a role in Europe’s rise to global dominance. Nonetheless, given that proof here is impossible, I can’t help seeing many of these explanations as “just-so” stories: entertaining, perhaps, but not legitimate scholarship.\n",

      "There are a lot of reasons I've seen thrown around for why the West got so powerful and became \"distinct\" which I feel became true sometime in the 15th-16th century. I don't think you can point to any individual thing that it all rested upon. Technology, culture, genetics, institutions, military victories, etc were all part of it. Around 1000 AD Europe was probably slightly behind or about as advanced as China or the Islamic world. Nothing really special. By 1500 they were more advanced, wealthy, and powerful. Enough so that little Portugese could circumnavigate Africa, make their way to India, and with just a few hundred men take on entire navies and win(Battle of Cochin 1504). I would posit that the high middle ages, fueled by the medieval agricultural revolution, helped lead to a more prosperous and powerful Europe. The invention and or adoption of the heavy plow, horse collar, horse shoe, whippletree, and three crop rotation systems all combined by the year 1000 AD to produce a kind of peasant plenty that allowed a lot more population growth and the rebirth of big towns and small cities. Economists have argued that European cities of the late medieval period were \"producer cities\" meaning they generated products that flowed out as opposed to cities in the MENA that tended to consume a lot of what the surrounding hinterlands made. Those producers cities in Italy helped create the Renaissance. Another major advantage over the MENA was the use of professional soldiers and not Mamluks(enslaved soldiers). In terms of technology by 1500 Europeans had invented or adopted fully mechanical clocks, printing presses, universities, muskets, caravels, windmills, magnetic compasses, astrolabes, blast furnaces, double entry book keeping, glasses, and heavy plows. Regarding the military situation by 1500 Byzantium was gone and the Ottoman Empire was very powerful and dominated the SE quadrant of Europe. But, the Iberians had fully liberated themselves from Islamic rule and the Golden Horde was on the verge of collapse in Russia. The 100 Years War was over for England and France. Medieval Europe was very violent, but for something like 800 years about 1-2% of the male population in Western Europe was executed for violent crimes. Violent crime rates plummeted in the late medieval period. That use of execution has to have had some selective pressure on the population's genes. The Black Plague killed anywhere from 75-150 million people in a few years. Throw in the long standing ban on cousin-marriage by the Church and I'm guessing you've got a recipe for much \"fitter\" people. Medieval Europe was also very commercial and reasonably well off. Incentives matter and the profit motive there was much stronger than in China or India where for regulatory and cultural reason you really didn't try to get ahead too much. Whereas Europeans, especially after the fall of Constantinople, were eager to fund merchent voyages around Africa or across the globe. In terms of income, some rough estimates suggest that during the 1000-1500 year period most parts of Europe were richer in terms of per capita income and wages than China, India, or Japan. Tyler mentions fragmentation. That was true for the German speakers of the Holy Roman Empire and probably had some advantages. But. also had disadvantages. Like every princeling wanting to tax your boat as it went down the Rhine. There was also centralization. England's transition from a heptarchy into a monarchy. The unification of Spain and the formation of France. Ultimately these places built empires where the Germans and Italians wouldn't unify until the 19th century. Medieval Agricultural Revolution(600-1000 AD)→High Middle Ages(1000-1300 AD)→Renaissance(1400-1600)→Age of Exploration(15th century onward)→Scientific Revolution(17th century)→Enlightenment(~18th century)→First Industrial Revolution(1750-1820) 1300-1400 was a crisis period that saw major wars, the Little Ice Age, Great Famine of 1315, and Black Death of 1346-1353. It was a big step backward.\n",

The best \"intellectual\" (as opposed to structural) argument available for Western exceptionalism is that Thomism, by making rational philosophy part of theology, made the West uniquely hospitable to intellectual inquiry and debate. This, of course, is consistent with science and liberalism emerging in the Catholic world, but not in the Eastern or Oriental Orthodox empires . . . but it doesn't give much evidence for Christianity per se being particularly valuable, as opposed to the healthiest of the various host memplexes for Aristotlean inquiry (Averroist Islam and post-Maimonides Rabbinical Judaism being crushed as heresy and restricted to an oppressed minority, respectively).\n",

      "\"Why Europe became distinct after the year 1000 and not before\" It wasn't like the Persians ever considered their rules gods, and Islam explicitly rejects the idea of any ruler being considered equal to god. Further the rulers and religious authorities in Islamic realms ca 1000 were often in various states of political conflict. As for the importance of the investiture contest, the term prince-bishop is useful to know. \"Bishops had been involved in the government of the Frankish realm and subsequent Carolingian Empire frequently as the clerical member of a duo of envoys styled Missus dominicus, but that was an individual mandate, not attached to the see. Prince-bishoprics were most common in the feudally fragmented Holy Roman Empire, where many were formally awarded the rank of an Imperial Prince Reichsfürst, granting them the immediate power over a certain territory and a representation in the Imperial Diet (Reichstag). The stem duchies of the German kingdom inside the Empire had strong and powerful dukes (originally, war-rulers), always looking out more for their duchy's \"national interest\" than for the Empire's. In turn the first Ottonian (Saxon) king Henry the Fowler and more so his son, Emperor Otto I, intended to weaken the power of the dukes by granting loyal bishops Imperial lands and vest them with regalia privileges. Unlike dukes they could not pass hereditary titles and lands to any descendants. Instead the Emperors reserved the implementation of the bishops of their proprietary church for themselves, defying the fact that according to canon law they were part of the transnational Catholic Church. This met with increasing opposition by the Popes, culminating in the fierce Investiture Controversy of 1076. Nevertheless, the Emperors continued to grant major territories to the most important (arch)bishops. The immediate territory attached to the episcopal see then became a prince-diocese or bishopric (Fürstbistum).[1] The German term Hochstift was often used to denote the form of secular authority held by bishops ruling a prince-bishopric with Erzstift being used for prince-archbishoprics. Emperor Charles IV by the Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the privileged status of the Prince-Archbishoprics of Mainz, Cologne and Trier as members of the electoral college. At the eve of the Protestant Reformation, the Imperial states comprised 53 ecclesiastical principalities.\"\n",

I'm confused Even if Alex is making this claim somewhat facetiously, it suggests either a very unorthodox understanding of politics or an utterly naive one. If we think of politics as the division of power and resources -- i.e., the process of determining who gets what, when, and how, as Laswell suggested -- then it's all but impossible to separate money from politics. I suppose the libertarian response is that a smaller government has less resources to gather and divide, which in turn reduces the politics in money. But I think that's too simple, since even the decision to limit government decisions is ultimately a political one that will produce relative winners and losers. Genuinely confused here.\n",

      "One and a half cheers for Ezra Klein reading Mancur Olsen and making a few perceptive observations on it. However, Klein still can't see beyond his own priors on redistribution: he thinks that using government to seed innovation and then chopping down any business or individual who successfully run with it is some kind of sustainable model for growth, because it will ameliorate the inequality that Klein thinks is the root of current low levels of trust in both markets and government. By this tortured logic, appeasing and amplifying populist resentments becomes a means of sating them, while demonizing and punishing innovators becomes a means of incentivizing them. When has this ever been the case? That's why, contra Alex, I view \"supply side progressivism\" as a nonstarter - a bit of rhetorical hand waving ultimately no more coherent than MMT. I also think that Klein has not really grasped the import of public choice arguments about the sorts of people and behavior that “big government” elicits. Klein quotes Olson saying that “the incentive to produce is diminished. The incentive to seek a larger share of what is produced increases. The reward for pleasing those to whom we sell our goods or labor declines, while the reward for evading or exploiting regulations, politics, and bureaucracy, and for asserting our rights through bargaining or complex understandings becomes great.” To see where this leads, I think one needs to go beyond Olsen to Janos Kornai’s insights about “economies of shortage” and “soft budget constraints”; perhaps Klein’s next reading assignment should be Kornai’s “Growth, Shortage and Efficiency: A Macrodynamic Model of the Socialist Economy” or “Dynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy: Two Essays on the Nature of Capitalism.” Of course the so-called centrally planned economy is an extreme case. But I suggest that the sclerotic state capitalist economy is symptomatic of where \"supply side progressivism\" ends up. How do we stop short of flying too close to the sun? Will we know we’ve flown to high only when we find ourselves plummeting earthward with our wings burnt off? Finally, about renters NIMBY. There have been some good comments on this point. I would only add as a general observation a caution against characterizing property rights in pure black-and-white terms, i.e. owners have all the rights, tenants have none. Even where housing markets remain relatively unregulated this is not the case, because of necessarily incomplete contracting (cf. Alchian, Coase, Demsitz, Hart, Williamson, etc.). So it is not really surprising that renters should see neighborhood (“backyard”) amenities as part of the bundle of informal rights they have acquired with their lease.\n",

      "An example of Alex missing the big picture by overly focusing on financial equations is with renter opposing new construction. Alex sees this as irrational or ignorant behavior on the renters part, because ceteris paribus more housing units will mean lower rental rates. But the renters reality is that rarely happens. New apartment blocks built down the street does not lead to a lowering of their own rent by 10% or whatever. Best case is that it leads to lower and slower rental increases in the future. On the other hand, new construction leads directly to more people in the near future. Which means increased congestion, a heavier burden on infrastructure. More demand for public services. And an increase in public disorder, which is highly correlated to increased density. The net result is an immediate negative impact on the quality of life for the renters. Counterbalance by a theoretical benefit of lower rent costs years into the future. At which point many of the renters will have moved anyway. So looking at the whole picture, it is entirely rational for renters to oppose new construction near them and irrational for them to support it.\n",

      "One of the areas where they were talking past each other was the self interested actions of people in government or influencing government. Ezra apparently understands this as meaning purely financial self interest. IE greed or corruption. With the broader definition just meaning an equivalent of motivation. Alex focuses on the financial aspect and goes into 2nd and 3rd order effects to demonstrate his point. IMO a better response would be that money is just a means to an end. Self interest can be temporally focused on acquiring money to affect an ultimate end. But it is the ultimate end that motivates the self interest. And money is not the only way to the end. For example, people that want to live in a specific type of community can achieve that end by acquiring money and moving to such a community. Or they could get the government to use compulsion to achieve that type of community. Both are self interest motivated to s specific goal. But Ezra would not see the latter as self interested motivation.\n",

      "I particularly liked it when Ezra backed Alex into the corner, and he retreated. But, before we get there, I want to remind people of what we have learned from Thaler and other behavioral economists on the issue of \"fairness\" since Mancur Olson's book which is the subject of the discussion: that people will reject offers or spurn the person making them if they perceive unfairness, even if it comes at a cost to oneself, or if it is viewed as necessary to permit other trades. (See research on Dictator Game, etc. and research on group punishment). With that in mind, here is the transcript, and the retreat where they are talking about how meetings have gotten larger to accommodate more views: ALEX TABARROK: Well, I think, frankly, it’s become more feminized. The virtues have shifted towards the feminine side of the spectrum, if I can be politically incorrect. Like safety, safety is a big one, right? So anything you can justify in terms of safety or justify in terms of the children — we’re doing it for the children — that’s a big one. Fairness is another one — equality in access, in speaking, all of these kinds of things. Like, everybody has to be heard, that kind of fairness. That’s one of the reasons just for having meetings is so that you give everybody an opportunity to be heard. Well, that’s fine, but that means that we have to hear from a lot more people, and things get slowed down. So to the extent that people frame their lives and careers in terms of heroic virtues, those virtues have shifted towards the more feminine side, as opposed to the Howard Roark, you’re going to build it my way, or I’m going to blow it up, right? It doesn’t get much play anymore. EZRA KLEIN: But when you put it like that, I think people can hear that as offensive, but you could also hear it as actually a good and overdue correction. A society that cares about children, a society that wants to make sure it’s hearing from different people and different kinds of people, a society more concerned about equality. I mean, rather than thinking about this as a disease of prosperity, that makes it sound like an overdue benefit. ALEX TABARROK: Yeah, I mean, that is the problem, is that it’s Apollo and Dionysus. There’s arguments for both sides. And the issue is try to find something in the middle perhaps. I think we’ve swung too far. And the evidence for that is precisely that people like yourself, who are thinking about these things more prospectively, see that some of the things you want are becoming impossible because people are paying too much attention to all of these other virtues.\" https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-alex-tabarrok.html What is interesting is that in marketing and consumer psychology we recognized the importance of fairness, but for others, fairness appears to be a friction. It isn't. People wouldn't comply with a decision if it were perceived as unfair. Apollo and Dynonysus indeed. Hope this comment won't be taken down.\n",

      "Alex replied to a comment from Ezra, \"To get money out of politics, you have to get politics out of money.\" Considering we each have a different value system for how money is spent, how can money be depoliticized? I would be interested to hear your approach. This effort is a good start to reconciling libertarian and progressive factions. Innovation is sorely lacking in this country. Policy has become schizophrenic. There is a real tension between the world we have and the world some of us want. Many conservatives tout local solutions. \"The federal government is captured by industry and state/local government is better equipped to solve it.\" I agree, but state governments and county governments are also captured by bad actors in their districts. Except this guy you have known since kindergarten and you see each other at church every week. There is this sense that he could never damage the land you both grew up on and face you with a clear conscious. The problem of innovation as I see it from working in state government is complex. There is a fear that you might get it wrong and waste taxpayer money or a fear that you will draw the ire of a powerful company or politician. Agencies within states suffer from this twofold problem. Cities suffer from a additional problem, home rule. Nashville or Memphis want change but the governor can't be seen tolerating liberal thinking. He would have to endure scolding on Fox News or OAN. The assault on government has produced nihilism and malaise. So we wait. Wait for the next generation to see the value in new approaches to old problems.\n",

Perhaps I am beginning to attack a strawman but I get the impression Japan is often pointed to by various online YIMBYs as the promised land, a housing supply-sider's wonderland where an open development code means home-ownership is affordable for all at young ages. So perhaps Korea is different from their Japanese across the water, from whom they've borrowed much of their developmental model? However, Japan actually doesn't seem that unusual in this regard - \"According to a new study, the UK is one of the world's toughest countries for first-time buyers.

      "An excellent discussion. I think one thing those who champion the public choice theory overlook is history. Before the reforms adopted in the 1930s, firms and their owners had no check on what they elected to do, no unions, no regulators, and they could be harsh in their treatment of individuals who tried to challenge them. The regulatory state was adopted in that context, the regulators to help bring order and stability to the chaos, with large unions providing a balance of power for large employers. That was the environment coming out of WWII, the period after WWII marked by shared prosperity. Sure, there were conflicts between labor and management, but mostly order and stability. Of course, we know what happened, a shift in the public mood due in large part to the Vietnam War and domestic racial unrest, and a succession of law and order administrations that vilified unions and sought to conflate the regulatory state and the civil rights movement. Rather than fight the regulatory state, Nixon enlarged it, while appointing administrators that were mostly hostile to labor and opposed to the regulatory state. Reagan was even bolder, appointing administrators whose job was to dismantle the agencies they administered, while at the same time promoting an agenda (including large deficits) that helped shift industry to Asia, weakening labor to the point that there is no balance of power between labor and management, management, with the help from courts packed with judges who are hostile to both labor and the regulatory state. The public choice theory puts a nice gloss on this history, the gloss making the history opaque. The real issue is whose interest does the regulatory state promote: the public interest or private interests? Of course, the public choice theory includes the premise that there is no public interest, only private interests (including the private interests of those who work in the regulatory state). In other words, there is no issue to discuss because there is no such thing as the public interest.\n",

      "I agree that Putin needs something, although I am not sure wrecking Ukraine will do it. I am not sure what will satisfy him for an off-ramp and note that David Ignatius says nobody knows what Putin's endgame is. I sure as heck do not know. Based on Russian media, I would say that he will remove (most of) the troops now exercising in Belarus. He has too loudly proclaimed he will to the Russian people. But that is only about 35,000 of the roughly 150,000 or so that are \"near\" the Ukrainian border. So, even with them out, Putin is still in a position to invade or cause lots of trouble militarily for Ukraine. I do not know where the 7000 the US says were moved to \"near\" the Ukrainian border, but probably not in Belarus. I think the main implication of a removal from Belarus will be that Putin will not be that he makes a direct attack on Kyiv. But he has plenty of other options. Regarding his publicized removal of troops, well, that was a train moving across the bridge he built to connect Crimea with Russia proper. While this was a sort of pullback, the message about Crimea on that is pretty clear. Crimea is part of Russia, period. I do not know where this is going, and it sure is not clear from Russian media, where they continue happy talk about the Olympics, although those are about to end, as well as doing things like showing various Ukrainian comedians on TV. Really. So what might Putin take? Obviously there is the possibility of a bunch of deals about where various weapons might be, but so far he seems not to be interested in them much. Of course the item he has made the most noise about has probably been keeping Ukraine out of NATO. Well, this is not a simple matter. Zelensky ran on having a referendum on joining NATO, but he has not done it and probably will not. The problem is a referendum raises the problem of whether or not the Donbas republics vote or not. Keeping them out would aid a pro-join-NATO vote, but keeping them out would accept that they are not part of Ukraine, which is also not a go. Zelensky has said \"maybe joining NATO is just a dream,\" and it has been loudly and repeatedly stated by many that Ukraine will not be joining NATO any time soon. But Putin does not seem to have accepted that, while it does not seem at all likely or even politically possible for Zelensky to make any sort of definite promise Ukraine will never join NATO. This difficult issue does not seem to offer much for Putin. That leaves the long running matter of the Donbas republics. Increasingly I think this may be where something might be provided for Putin. In contrast to South Ossetia et al, Russia has not recognized the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk. There has been a stalemate militarily, although recently Ukraine scared them by using Turkish supplied drones. It is my suspicion that this is what got Putin going with all this. The \"solution\" to this situation was supposed to be the Minsk Accords, but neither side has implemented them: Putin has not stopped militarily supporting the republics, and Ukraine has not granted the republics the degree of autonomy called for in them. So the lower Duma has voted to formally recognize their independence and have called on Putin to do it. Maybe this is it, the thing that will give him something for an out. Recognize them and arm them sufficiently to offset the drones. That will make a mess of the Minsk Accords and will take away from Ukraine, if not necessarily \"wreck\" them. Heck, he could even support them grabbing a bit more territory in spots, just to emphasize the recognition of their independence. Anyway, this is how I see it now, with this matter maybe the best out.\n",

Alternatively, maybe his main goal is to make a demonstration: after all, the mere fact that Russia has demonstrated its ability to mass a big, credible invasion army in Eastern Europe is quite an accomplishment, and sends an important strategic message. 2. One problem with finding a diplomatic solution to this crisis is that Russia hasn’t actually done anything other than buildup troops, make threats, and launch cyber attacks.

This is not to say that Russia has benevolent intentions or a righteous cause. I'm almost certain they don't. But I'm also fairly certain that Ukraine is a far away country that has little impact on the actual security of the United States. On the other hand, it's right next store to Russia, there's a lot of issues of border disputes and ethnic and political rivalries. That doesn't make the Russians right, but, like, if the average American saw something like a hostile government take power in Mexico and seek to make a military defense treaty with China, and bring in a bunch of Chinese military advisors to start training their troops, they probably wouldn't much like it.

A huge troop build-up for bluffing purposes doesn't help \"wreck Ukraine\". This is solidifying opposition, as well as drawing the world's attention and support. Continued low-level actions that sow internal discord without making this into a major world issue would surely serve Putin better if he simply wants to destabilize the country. The major troop build-up (assuming it is a bluff) seems aimed at extracting concessions from major world leaders, not Ukraine. (And of course this matches what Putin has actually demanded). At this point, I see two options: 1) It's a bluff aimed at the US and EU that has failed. 2) He actually does intend to invade Ukraine. Hopefully it is 1), and hopefully then Putin will climb down while doing a minimum to save face (But it could be that he will move on to an actual invasion as plan B).\n",

      "The Caleb example is instructive. Given his condition, he should not be in school during any period where RSVs have a significant chance of circulating. This includes any typical flu season. No precautions short of enclosing every child and adult in a mobile plexiglass bubble (with exhaust tubes going directly to the ventilation system to be expelled into the air), will balance his risk/reward appropriately. Cloth or surgical masks, even if worn properly, can't come close to achieving this goal. While mRNA vaccination is a good thing for many of the kids and certainly Caleb, the data shows that forcing those on everyone in the school won't be enough to reduce his risks of getting infected enough given the likely outcome of such for him. The flu vaccines too (especially) - they're just not good enough. It is therefore pointless to impose these costs on the rest of the kids. It won't help Caleb enough to make it sensible for him to be there. He should stay home. Since his parents have already paid (possibly against their will) for his education, the schools/government/tax-payers should accommodate by providing him with substitute instruction that does not impose any health risks. Better yet, they should refund all of his parents' tax dollars so they can self-interestedly shop for the best available substitute education.\n",

      "\"masks delay but do not prevent infection.\" Agreed. So masks probably saved thousands of lives if you were wearing them at the start of the pandemic and delayed getting sick. The mortality rate for inpatients at the start was well over twice what it is now. Large benefit. If you were wearing a mask 6 months later less benefit as we were better at treating covid but still meaningful. Now that we have vaccines and pretty soon enough paxlovid to be meaningful the return is pretty small. I think we should keep wearing them in hospitals (which means we have to put up with the death threats and violence from the anti-maskers) but otherwise I think it should be a local decision. What we see in our area is that the anti-masker people are pretty aggressive. In the schools the non-mask wearing kids are pretty aggressive about harassing those who do. Some of those kids are being raised by grandparents or have siblings who have health issues and want to do what they can to keep them safe. It is interesting that people who claim to dislike mandates on liberty principles seem to be OK with mandates AGAINST wearing masks. Anyway, if I asked I would let teachers decide if they want to wear masks and same for students. If the area has a surge and hospitals are getting overrun schools should be able to reimpose them if they want. Steve\n",

      "MR has gotten some important things right about the virus, and it’s consistently been an excellent part of a healthy, Covid related information diet. However, it’s definitely not immune from the public health irrationality bug. In this case, the first thing to note is that Tyler chose the least sympathetic of the pro-mask perspectives in the article: the girl concerned about Pawpaw, or the boy with serious lung issues, have more compelling stories. Next, the idea that teachers should be subjected to a no-mask requirement, when they’re already facing labor market discrimination by not being able to take long term advantage of work from home, or hybrid home/office arrangements, is problematic. Is it really the state’s place to tell its employees that they can’t take a basic public health precaution, particularly when the value of that precaution has been affirmed by countless experts? The issue isn’t what Tyler thinks about masks; rather, it’s whether a person’s view of masks falls within a range of reasonable opinion. And for both teachers and students, a reasonable person could continue to favor mask-wearing. Furthermore, by imposing a mandatory no-mask rule for teachers, while giving students a choice, the state would be sending three negative signals. First, it would be advertising that it isn’t very bright: logically, the higher risk population (teachers), should have more flexibility than the lower risk group (students). Second, it would single out mask-wearing students as abnormal because there wouldn’t be adult role models to validate their choices (although I’m not sure whether kids take cues from adults as much as they did when I grew up). Third, and perhaps most importantly, it would be suggesting that the state should have the right to manage individual freedom in the same way that people handle their thermostats: turning it up in some rooms, and down in others, depending on personal preferences. As for the broader question about dealing with arguments over masks in schools, or whether the mandates should continue, I don’t have an opinion. Sadly, the pandemic is still alive and kicking, and unless Tyler is arguing that getting Covid is a good thing, then postponing it still makes sense (better vaccines, treatments, and, perhaps, making the burden on hospitals more manageable by spacing out cases). On the other hand, social interaction is a vital part of school, and I think a reasonable student could have a strong preference against wearing masks, particularly if they’re fully vaccinated. Overall, I’m not sure if school mask mandates are still a good idea, but I’m positive that mask prohibition is a stinker.\n",

How representative are these stories about masks in schools in the US? I'm sure there are still schools here in England that still encourage mask wearing, but my sense is that it is not like in the US. Masking wearing in shops in England is no longer mandatory. I reckon it's about 50% in my local supermarket. Pubs and restaurants are busy, so is my gym. I go the office 2-3 times a week - 100+ people, no masks. I think Scotland & Wales continue to have higher rates of mask wearing (mandatory in shops still), but I believe there's no clear difference in pandemic outcomes across the UK nations that can be attributed to differences in mask uptake. Maybe Michael Osterholm is right, cloth masks are worthless and only N95s make a difference. Most masks here are simple cloth masks.

      "Schools by their nature have always been ripe for disagreement and disruption, as student push boundaries and teachers and administrators try to maintain order and decorum. The Supreme Court has made clear that students while at school do not have the same constitutional rights as when away from school, such as 4th amendment rights; indeed, schools may even impose restrictions on students outside the school boundaries. And students will push the boundaries of acceptable behavior. In my day the battle was over such things as the acceptable length of a boy's hair or a girl's skirt, students willing to risk suspension over the freedom to wear long hair or short skirts. Hence, it's not at all surprising that schools today have become a battleground over mask-mandates and similar pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile, I would not be surprised if the Supreme Court rules against the enforceability of school mask mandates, resulting in the ironic situation that students have the freedom to choose not to wear a mask during a pandemic but don't have the 4th amendment freedom against what otherwise would be an unlawful search and seizure. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rynxqdNMry4&ab_channel=SebastianWalter\n",

      "My position on masks, which I suspect our host and many commenters hold, is that they provide essentially the smallest marginal benefit possible. I believe this because this assumption is explicitly baked into masking guidelines and the expectations/behaviors of rulemakers. I am not allowed to remove my mask, except in the gym, at a restaurant, or on a _cramped airplane surrounded by strangers to eat a bag of peanuts._ If the gain from masking is so small that I and hundreds of stangers can all relax the rule at the same time for a soda and crackers, in an airplane on a direct flight, or the governor can relax it at the Super Bowl, why should I believe masks would keep people who see each other every day at work or school from getting the disease eventually? If vaccines work 100%, or you think current ones don't but the next one will, your time and effort should go to that rather than masks. Every unmasked person you waste time thinking about is a jab that you didn't schedule for someone over the phone, for instance. WaPo conveys the high transitory costs of a law \"...ensuring every one of Virginia’s more than 1.8 million public and private schoolchildren will face masking decisions and tensions at school in days to come...As the adults battle over the merits of masking, Virginia students have been forced to navigate the real-life fallout.\" 1) The political cases are the least compelling. At a moderate level are the kids who just hate masks and whose glasses fog up. Most compelling, of course, are the girl whose grandparent has multiple ailments, and the student who has lung problems. The grandparent case would seem to be best solved by solved by testing, no? 2) Ultimately, the story should hinge on targeted action for the benefit of Caleb, the young man most endangered by COVID. What is shocking about this story, and COVID policy in general, is how wildly (and evenly) it distributes costs and benefits. Kids are the group least likely to be hospitalized by a lot and still under the most restrictive rules outside of the elderly in nursing homes. If you know a single kid is at serious risk of COVID, you throw the kitchen sink at his problems, make all accomodations, Zoom classes, plexiglass for him, etc. The WaPo comment section is arguing that \"optional\" is a terrible policy, but leave the mask mandate in place there is still a high chance that there's an outbreak at schools, like Omicron this January. Inventing your way out of this problem for the most vulnerable is far more practical AND ethically respectable than, say, adults effectively leaving the choice in the hands of pre-teens. 3) People seem to be running a mix of optimized hedonism and CYA when it makes the least sense. A friend of mine had one covid test. He got covid tested before going to a summer concert, effectively wasting the test since he didn't know if the other people were testing. Your prior would be that you don't have covid - no symptoms, summer, etc. You would want to test *afterwards* if you were going to the concert. If you go to a concert and use your one test beforehand, you are more worried about *you* spreading covid than the spread of covid, right? Is this really liberal concern for your fellow man? On the other hand, if a seven year old takes of his mask to pick his nose, sneezes, and unleashes an outbreak upon his class, do we hold this kid responsible for deaths, or the people who put him in that situation? Does it make a difference if the kid sneezes during lunchtime, when masks are off for everyone? 4) The newspaper providing the names of these kids is deranged. If it's as bad as you say, a political \"war zone\", each of those kids deserves an alias to protect them from retribution by teachers who consume too much political news ...like, idk, WaPo.\n",

      "\"We report here the presence of sarbecoviruses close to SARS-CoV-2 whose RBDs differ from that of SARS-CoV-2 by only one or two contact residues, that strongly bind to the hACE2 protein, and mediate a hACE2-dependent entry and replication into human cells. Despite the absence of the furin cleavage site, these viruses may have contributed to SARS-CoV-2’s origin and may intrinsically pose a future risk of direct transmission to humans\" This is rather equivocal with respect to gain of function. One could argue that it makes gain of function engineering more likely. After all, the furin cleavage site is the key. As yet no naturally occurring coronavirus has been observed with this feature. And some virologists have estimated the probability of its natural occurrence being exceedingly low. Having a sample like this with hACE2 protein binding present in a bat-phillic virus makes it an attractive candidate for gain of function research...and for collection by those centers focused on coronavirus research...like the institute in Wuhan. No center would advertise this research or anything connected with it including collection before and certainly not after an accidental release. So, does this paper really decrease the probability of gain of function research? Perhaps you could argue that it increases it. Equivocal.\n",

Worm infection is common in poor countries and rare in rich countries. Consider that worm infection weakens the immune system. If someone with worm infection AND Covid is given ivermectin, the drug clears the parasitical infection, and so boosts the immune system. That allows the body to fight Covid more effectively. In rich countries, it won't do any good. So be open minded about this. The body and immune system are complicated. A drug can work for some but not others. Don't overgeneralize.

      "> Lowers the probability of the “gain of function” hypotheses. Not really. The fact is gain or function research was being done, and it wasn't supposed to be. In hindsight, does ANYONE think doing this type of research in China using protective measures on par with what your dentist is using is a good thing? No, they don't. And the paper trail is very clear on this. And yet, it was done. PS. The real problem here is we have a known starting point that has key mutations at a point every researcher says \"Oh yeah, that's the spot to make this dangerous\" but no mutations outside of that. That is what is baffling. We might find something in nature that looks similar at that same spot (the spot that makes it dangerous to humans) but they will almost certainly have mutations outside of the area too. Remember: The researchers all lied here. What they said in private (along the lines of \"Holy hell, this looks engineered\") and what they said in public (along the lines of \"this has no signs of coming from a lab and probably came from a wet market\") indicates these people will lie about anything. They worked together to shape a public message that was the opposite of their private message. Does anyone believe those in charge of this type of research for the US performed admirably here? That they went above and beyond with transparency? That they let the scientific process play out? Nope. It was an all time low for the science.\n",

It's the one thing that every worker I know cares about, but shows up on almost no graph I see re: productivity or profits. 2) WFH has not only ended commutes, but also led to a lot of big changes in scheduling. Our office has rolling window of acceptable worktimes now, between 6-2 and 9-5. This reduces a lot of the pressures to conform to an office schedule (read: add an extra hour to your workday just because) but I think these work hours reflect what was obviously going to be a preferred option if it were ever available. If that time isn't included in previous measurements, it is again something that workers care about very much that might not make it to a chart. 3) Is this how COVID gains bipartisan appeal?

      "As a single person, the golden age of travel on the Northeast Corridor was in the months after lockdown, when Amtrak capped capacity at fifty percent, and everyone had a two seat row to themselves. At that point, people were still really scared of Covid, so the mask mandate wasn’t an issue at all. However, it was also prior to the more transmissible variants, so you could enjoy a cup of coffee without feeling that you had to engage in complex risk calculations. My first trip from DC to NYC in June 2020 was an absolute joy: traffic was very light, so the Uber/cab rides were a snap, plus Union Station was practically empty, and, by NYC standards, Penn Station was too. It was by far my most efficient and pleasant Amtrak experience, and drinking a medium regular Dunkin while looking out the window felt positively luxurious under the circumstances. Regarding the specifics of this post, however, my guess is that since Acela tickets are generally more, and sometimes much more expensive that the regional trains - even though the time/comfort advantage isn’t huge - they appeal largely to businesses travelers who want the freedom to handle calls and meetings during the trip. And if this practical preference opens up space for leisure travelers like me with highly sensitive hearing, then that’s great. Although, regrettably, Amtrak travel has reverted to the pre-pandemic slog; price controls might be bad economics, but seat controls were glorious.\n",

      "Prof. Cowen pushes back against a true libertarian, one whose commitment to individual liberty is near the top of her ethical heirarchy. As I listened to Prof. Cowen’s talk of “nudging” the people through force of government, it occured to me that what is near the top of his ethical heirarchy is maintaining his excellent life exactly as it is. If higher ed is mostly signaling, that threatens him. Smoke in restaurants irritates his enjoyment of food. He doesn’t enjoy alcohol, so of course it is dangerous and destructive. He’s shown over the past two years that he is fine with government deciding what pandemic information may and may not be discussed. Prof. Flanagan posits that freedom of speech covers even what the CDC calls COVID misinformation, as well as speech that she finds personally disgusting. Has Prof. Cowen ever advocated for any ethical position that might roll back his influence and globe-trotting, food-tasting lifestyle in the slightest, or even cause him the slightest emotional or physical comfort? Of course some of these positions may enhance the health and well-being of others. But what business does a libertarian economist have in advising governments to use the full force of law and regulation to coerce (a more accurate term than “nudge”) others into abiding by his own personal preferences?\n",

      "The paternalism discussion was interesting, but her point was not fully thought through. We have a representative government that, by and large, is giving effect to a consensus about how society should be ordered. In the case of smoking, the majority of people don't want to assume the risks and costs of a potentially harmful action, so it is largely banned. This is not paternalism. But if it was paternalism (a small group making welfare decisions for others based on presumed helplessness) wouldn't it be morally necessary? Second hand smoke exposure in very young children correlates with higher rates of lung cancer. That means that if you smoke around my kids, you might be killing them. Does the \"freedom\" to smoke mean the freedom to harm others? What about my freedom to defend myself and my family? If your smoking could kill my kids, does that give me the right to kill you to save them? I never see libertarians really grapple with the inevitable real world impacts of their views. The \"freedom\" to smoke or to drink and drive is also the freedom to kill. How does it not include a corresponding freedom to defend? Oe we just accept that some amount of patnerlism (again, not quite the right concept) is necessary to avoid the destructive effects of \"freedoms\" that include killing others. And if you want to extend this and say \"why not ban driving\"--well, we do regulate the tool to maximize safety and we make drivers liable for their harms. So to make that point work, you need to send smokers, drinkers, etc. to jail or some other form of punishment with much greater frequency.\n",

      "My favorite sentence of the piece was this one: \"I wonder if we have fully grappled with the fury this is causing in Afghanistan, and how that fury might haunt us in the future.\" We are on a hamster wheel! Tied together forever! We must either be building them dams, feeding them, providing weapons to fend off the Russians, bombing them, or occupying them. And they'll be furious no matter what we do, irrespective of \"good\" or \"bad\", \"worked\" or didn't. It's almost diabolical, the way these putatively weak states endlessly play the United States. Afghanistan had less than 8 million people when the US began its misadventures in 1950. If the Great Game is a numbers game, Afghanistan is doing splendidly, despite the death toll from the Long War. America is mad about \"psychology\", as far as I can tell, but Ezra Klein cannot entertain for one second, the psychology of resentment. Everyone occasionally looks at their cat and imagines, what if you were big? Would you be eating me right now? A Pashtun friend of mine from Peshawar, with family land in the tribal area, casually mused, after 9/11, that had they the power, were the positions reversed, their vengeance on us would have been far more total than anything the US was contemplating. He probably foresaw what would follow upon the bombs. His long residence in the US might have suggested he meant this in an admiring way, and of course he was a very gracious man - but my experience of the way he could transform at parties, after a drink (his religious practice was nil) into a coarser, more bragadoccio version of himself, where Indians almost indistinguishable from himself in their immigrant experience, were present -- made me know he was simply viewing Americans as weak, patsies. Klein believes he's presenting a complex picture of things - but his worldview is troublingly simplistic. Perhaps someone so young - and he seems like he could be young for a very long time - should not have been awarded an NYT column.\n",

      "The model here is not a new one: An evil regime holds innocents hostage. Whether its the Taliban, Castro regime in Cuba, CCP in China, or a terrorist cell hiding behind \"human shields\", the dilemma is the same: striking at the regime --- militarily or economically --- can cause collateral damage to the innocents. Maybe, the morally righteous thing really is to let the evil regime do whatever it wants to avoid such collateral damage. But, at least, lets recognize the situation for what it is. The Taliban is not the legitimate government of Afghanistan but it would seize and control Afghanistan's assets if permitted to do so. If one just unfroze the assets, they would become Taliban assets even if, by right, it's the \"Afghan people's money\". I don't know if it's really as unprecedented as some make it out to be that, when a criminal enterprise gains assets even illegally as the Taliban has gained Afghanistan's assets, that those assets are used to pay the criminal enterprise's debts to its victims, in this case the Taliban's debts to its 9/11 victims. Also, does anyone doubt that at least some, if not a substantial portion, of aid to Afghanistan at this point would fall into Taliban hands? If one truly wanted to ensure that the frozen assets were returned to the Afghan people along with more economic aid, then one shouldn't have allowed the Taliban to take control in the first place. It's pretty rich to advocate allowing the Afghan people to fall to the Taliban a few months ago when we could have stopped it, then turn around now to decry the consequences of that.\n",

      "On #1 I'm a student in a PPE program in the Southwest, and it's been my experience that interdisciplinary programs should always be niche. I love using tools from various social science disciplines to tackle problems: they give perspective and an excellent framework for understanding broad issues. But they don't substitute for specialized knowledge, which remains essential for any effective social science research. I may be able to develop interesting solutions to complicated problems using tools from politics, philosophy, and economics, but I struggle when I hit research questions that require a lot of specialized knowledge to answer. Within the social sciences, abolishing interdisciplinary research would be suicidally stupid. Hard to say about the humanities though. It hasn't been my experience that the extremely specialized knowledge you'd expect from, say, an economics researcher, is going to be necessary for a humanities researcher to thrive.\n",

Same if they brought back some bat carcasses and examined the viruses present in them, and then some entrepreneurial janitor who was supposed to dispose of the carcasses according to sterility protocols instead sold them to a wet market.

      "Some of the early work on prediction markets was done by Charlie Plott at CalTech and Hewlett Packard on internal projections. Quoting from the paper, which also discusses the Iowa Electronic Market (IEM) here is some relevant discussion re self selection bias, general v. specific information, etc., that is worth considering: \"It is not clear that IEM participants have specific, specialized information that is not available for the general public. Many public reports, polls and summaries exist in the press and obviously affect IEM activities. Participants in the IEM have self-selected for participation, which has no specific bearing on whether they have private information or not. Thus, the predictions of the IEM could reflect an effective and sophisticated system of polling, a collection of personal intentions, a coordination mechanism of public information, or a combination of polls. While related, such patterns of underlying information can be differentiated from a pattern of private information (beyond the personal intention to vote) that resides in small amounts across the population. By contrast, only a relatively small number of people were chosen for participation in the Hewlett Packard IAM. They were selected specifically from different parts of the business operation because they were thought to have different patterns of information about the targeted event. These patterns of information, including market intelligence, specific information about big clients, and pricing strategies, were in need of aggregation. In addition, there were no public summaries of information available to the participants during the operation of the IAM.\" ... By contrast, in a business environment, participants need to be selected carefully. On one hand, it is not desirable to “miss” a person with much information. On the other hand, it might not be efficient to include many people without any relevant information. Indeed, little is known theoretically about the information size relative to the market that might be required for effective information aggregation to take place.\" Here is a link to the paper: https://authors.library.caltech.edu/44358/1/wp1131.pdf It is a classic Now, now one could say, maybe we should limit the polling mechanism to intelligence agencies. But, they often compartmentalize information, so you would need to lift some barriers. But, I guess the folks here did not know that the CIA gave a report on this subject already, which drew on their own assets. https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Unclassified-Summary-of-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdf I am supposed to be working on my taxes but this is more interesting.\n",

The Chinese did it. Too bad we don’t have leaders strong enough to ban all travel and trade with China and countries that allow travel and trade with China. Containment was a good strategy.

      "The casual empiricism that derives predictions from the latest election results doesn't cut it when we are talking about massive movements of ideas. Ideas circulate in a top-down manner from the more intellectually adept to the less. It's a trickle-down process. but it works, and nothing can reverse it except a countermovement of ideas at the top. This is why the world religions' myths perpetuate themselves generation after generation. The relatively adept (priests, teachers) indoctrinate children who go on to be parents who participate in the indoctrination of their own children. A common error is to assume that there's some reality check that can reverse this process if the ideas are bad ones. But this ignores the fact that reality is always interpreted through ideational/ideological lenses. Control education and the media (news and entertainment, low culture, and high culture) and you control how people see reality. That doesn't mean that when this process gets underway, there won't be political reverses for the hegemonic ideas. Reverses occur because the entire population isn't evenly educated (in this case, in woke ideas). The woke revolution has thus far mainly affected the ideas of children and recent college graduates, who in turn have seized control of virtually all institutions. But they will sometimes get ahead of their skis, not because reality is disproving their ideas but because their ideas are not yet hegemonic among those who are older, who outnumber the young. But that is just a matter of time. So optimism triggered by electoral victories is foolish. Elections are lagging indicators because even the undereducated, and the older college educated, can vote. (And even at that, Youngkin nearly lost in Va.!) But the massive woke ideological revolution proceeds to indoctrinate more and more people, regardless of who is the governor of Virginia or the president of the United States.\n",

Democratic politicians have realized this, and are rolling back mask mandates and pursuing other, non woke agendas like refunding police. Corporations, including corporate media, will probably catch on next. If this is peak woke, there will be a long tail as those who went along with wokeism to be “cool” and “forward thinking” slowly adjust. As for identify politics, that only works when white men are the common enemy. White men will over time eventually be less disproportionally in positions of power and the other races and genders will catch up. Asians are already breaking away as are Latinos.

      "Wokeism is in some sense a superficial manifestation of a sharply leftist cultural shift. The much deeper and more serious manifestation is of course the relentless collapse in fertility across the developed world. What are some recent numbers (lifetime births per woman / 2.1 is \"replacement\" level): USA 1.59; Scandinavia ~1.55; England 1.52; Scotland 1.32; Australia 1.64; Japan 1.3; South Korea 0.82, every one on a downward trend. Fertility among US-born Asian Americans, the most highly educated ethnicity in the US, was all the way down to about 1.3 births per woman in 2020 and likely fell another 0.05 or so since. See the @BirthGauge twitter feed for a huge trove of birth and fertility data. This is not a separate phenomenon but is tightly connected with wokeism: * Political affiliation has become extremely correlated with fertility: See https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/fertility_rate/fertility_rates.htm (choose 2020 as the year to get the latest data) https://www.aei.org/articles/the-conservative-fertility-advantage/ But this didn't used to be so true in the past. Before the leftist cultural revolution of the last few decades, fertility of Democrats and Republicans were much more similar. * Some 21% of generation Z identifies as LGBT, up from 4% of gen X, 2.6% of boomers and 0.8% of pre-boomers (!!) https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx That surely is manifesting in the collapsing fertility rates we are seeing concentrated in the youngest cohorts. (Links are necessary because this seems unbelievable.) So the most significant effect of the cultural triumph of leftism is not wokeism but something much deeper, a dramatic collapse fertility (which we have seen is tightly tied to political affiliation). And the effect of fertility driven demographic collapse may be the stiffest economic and civilizational headwind history has seen. (Even Korea's extreme fertility collapse is related to similar cultural shifts: religiosity in Korea has sharply declined and no country has more completely absorbed Western pop-culture -- to the point where Korea has become a leading exporter in that market.)\n",

      "I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a more obviously wrong prediction in my life. Demographics is destiny, Tyler. As long as ‘wokeness’ is inversely correlated with age, it’s going to keep getting worse. Wokeism will have peaked when we see a generation of kids that is more pro-free speech and anti-‘corrective racism/sexism’ than the last generation. Given that immigrants mostly assimilate in one generation, they won’t save us. Republicans may win elections - they still do sometimes - but winning in 2012 and 2016 didn’t even slow things down; the next Democratic admin will be more extreme than this one, and the one after it more so.\n",

      "\"Wokeism is likely to evolve into a subculture that is highly educated, highly White and fairly feminine.

Migrants seem to believe in the stuff about the Wicked Western White Patriarchy... But less so the bits where socialism (either in Nordic SocDem or more extreme flavours) and quota bureaucracy is the remedy. For Asian migrants it seems very much \"Oh, yes, the Whites were certainly bad in keeping the Asian man down, and keeping others down is the reason for the success of the backwards culture, which isn't committed to education and learning like we are, and particularly White men are bad...

      "> Latinos in particular seem more open to the Republican Party, Well, when you realize books in our schools are showing boys putting their mouths on the penis of another boy....and we're supposed to accept this as. Imagine if there was a book in school showing a boy (under 12) performing oral sex on or digitally penetrating a girl (under 12). Would we consider it a good and beautiful thing? Worse, parents \"of color\" have decided they don't like their kids writing explicit stories to be shared with teachers. Or drawing a picture of a pizza where ingredients mean certain things (black olives means you like to \"give oral\" was written in the assignment...the principal assured it the assignment was created, copied, and handed out by mistake). Or, parents \"of color\" have decided they don't want unqualified strangers (aka teachers) leading their kids down a path of sexual preference while keeping it secret from parents. That used to be called grooming. Or, maybe, a fat, sweaty single 40 year old male has zero business talking in private about sex to a 12 year old and keeping it secret from the parents. Yes, even if he's a teacher. We learned yesterday a teacher was charged with baking cupcakes for her class, and using her husbands semen as an admix in the cupcakes. And the kids ate them.

I base this off everything I have seen in my relatively short lifetime so far. Every conservative prediction I have ever seen about the left \"eating their own\", liberals going too far, a right wing backlash, or some kind of peak progressivism have never actually panned out. The left continues to double down and basically most Democrats have always just gone along with it and they gradually get more progressive. Ask yourself honestly in what way is the median/mean liberal less progressive on any issue relative to the median/mean liberal in 1980, 2000, or even 2015? Especially on issues of culture and social policy. If you told me back in 2010 or 2012 that feminists would be pushing to make sure naked men could walk around women's locker rooms I would have stared at you blank faced and shocked. Feminists are now diligently urging that pre-operation transpeople born as males but who identify as female must be given access to women's private spaces. There appears to be no sign that women are suddenly going to become conservatives and try to ban this.

      "On your last point, I'd just like to ask more conservatives to pursue PhD's. Stop whining so much and fight back. If you think higher ed is an important cultural institution, then become professors and change the institution. It turns out that most work in the social sciences and hard sciences is completely unrelated to one's partisanship. I think many outside of academia, including nearly all undergrads, think that political scientists spend all of their time arguing for why Democrats are better than Republicans, when actually, they're mostly arguing about whether some obtuse theory is a better explanation for political behavior than another. Is the information theory or distributive theory or party-centered theory of committee organization in Congress more accurate? Is lobbying vote-buying, information signaling, or legislative subsidy? You can be a Republican or a Democrat or neither and have great success in your research. And if you are wanting to fight the partisan fight, then let loose once you get tenure. Yes, you'll be one of only a few Republicans in your grad program. And yes, if you turn everything into a partisan fight, your colleagues will be annoyed with you, but it's not impossible to get through the gauntlet by being civil and biting your tongue every now and then. Along the way, you'll learn that a lot of the professors have beef with wokeism gone wild. Indeed, you may also find some fellow conservatives. But if you're going to tell women that they should suck it up and pursue higher paying jobs and stop whining about the gender gap in pay, then put on your big boy pants and do the same, and it would be better for higher education in the end if you did so.\n",

As for the faint praise of the Latino community as anti-woke, it's code for the Latino male role characterized by machismo and patriarchal authority without actually endorsing it.

The other four are AERi, QJE, RES, and Econometrica. Two of these have already played this product differentiation game, AER and Ecmta. The AER now has four field journals that go under \"American Economic Journal\" with Macro and three other fields following. Papers rejected by the AER but viewed as pretty good get suggested to go to one of those. They have done pretty well, although the Micro one has somehow lagged the other three from the beginning, I do not know why. Interestingly, if one looks at what I consider to the be most serious journal ranking, RePEc recursive discounted impact factor, three of them are ahead of the AER right now, with AEJ Macro competing for top journal of them all with QJE and Ecmta recently. But AER is still the member of the top five one must score in for tenure at certain places. Ectma has launched Theoretical Economics and Quantitative Economics. Neither of these has done as well as those AEJs, although they are pretty well respected. But they are nowhere near Ectma.
