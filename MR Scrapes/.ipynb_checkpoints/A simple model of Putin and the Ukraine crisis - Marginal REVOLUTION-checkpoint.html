    <p>I think the correct model here is &#8220;Putin has put down so many chips, he can&#8217;t walk away with nothing. He wants to wreck Ukraine (more than taking territory per se).Â  He will do the minimum amount he can that leaves him with a strong probability of having wrecked Ukraine, and no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>That still leaves a broad range of possible outcomes, but at the moment that is my mental model for updating with new information.</p>

He seems to assert that Ukrainians are really Russians (but not the other way around, which is of course illogical).  Assume, for the moment, he believes the proposition as stated and intends to act of it.   What follows?  He may be in the act of reclaiming land through a sense of identity and grievance, however misgiven.  It&#039;s possible to overthink this.  Look at the man&#039;s words first.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396777,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Roland&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 10:55:36&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;1.

It does not mean creating a new, dominant military power.&lt;br \/&gt;\n3. Aid can be conditioned.&lt;br \/&gt;\n4. True. I submit there&#039;s a bigger risk of blow-up down the line if Russian tanks roll into Kiev.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Power flows to vacuums, and the reason Russian forces are lined up against Ukraine is because Ukraine is too much of a vacuum at the moment. We can partly rectify that by making a show--today, tomorrow, and the next day--of American and British anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles being unloaded in Kiev. Our choice: Russian power, or Western power. But power there will be.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396765,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Roland&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 10:43:11&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;1. Russia will not cut off gas to Germany. It needs the money.&lt;br \/&gt;\n2. \&quot;To the teeth\&quot; is to the degree that the Ukrainian military&#039;s training--which they have been receiving--allows. Obviously, it does not mean turning them into a new, dominant military power.&lt;br \/&gt;\n3. It&#039;s easy to condition further US military aid on how it&#039;s used.&lt;br \/&gt;\n4. Yes, this is a risk. I submit it&#039;s a bigger a risk not to deter Putin right now.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Power flows to vacuums, and Ukraine is too much of a vacuum at the moment. This is why Putin&#039;s forces are lined up against it. Making a show of additional US and British anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles being unloaded in Kiev--today, tomorrow, and the next day--can only help the situation by filling the vacuum with US and British power.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Our choice: Russian power, or Western power.

But true power requires the willingness to use it. If we make a \&quot;show of strength\&quot; we have to be willing to follow through or it becomes a show of weakness.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like, suppose we do as you suggest and start flying in missiles to Kiev. Why shouldn&#039;t Putin, the moment the invasion started (which might be tomorrow by what we&#039;re seeing) just shoot down one of our planes? &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We&#039;ll be mad and call it an outrageous provocation, of course, and otherwise stamp our feet, but unless we back that up with something significant (and keep doing it), it would be a show of weakness, no?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, maybe you&#039;re saying, \&quot;Putin wouldn&#039;t dare do that!\&quot; but why wouldn&#039;t he? If he can publicly hit us and not get hit back, that&#039;s a victory for him. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is what I keep coming around to. The game unravels to \&quot;who wants it more\&quot;. Who is willing to keep escalating? The West has pretty apparent limits. The limits to which Putin will escalate aren&#039;t clear, but I figure \&quot;making the West look stupid and impotent\&quot; is a feature for him and not a bug.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397064,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Roland&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 15:54:00&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Putin hasn\u2019t attacked yet. We need to fly in the arms before he does. I wouldn\u2019t suggest flying American planes into skies Russia controls or partly controls. This is about strengthening e Ukrainians, not confronting Russia directly.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397064]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396916,160397064]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396612,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Barkley Rosser&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 21:00:33&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I agree that Putin needs something, although I am not sure wrecking Ukraine will do it.  I am not sure what will satisfy him for an off-ramp and note that David Ignatius says nobody knows what Putin&#039;s endgame is.  I sure as heck do not know.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Based on Russian media, I would say that he will remove (most of) the troops now exercising in Belarus.  He has too loudly proclaimed he will to the Russian people.  But that is only about 35,000 of the roughly 150,000 or so that are \&quot;near\&quot; the Ukrainian border.  So, even with them out, Putin is still in a position to invade or cause lots of trouble militarily for Ukraine. I do not know where the 7000 the US says were moved to \&quot;near\&quot; the Ukrainian border, but probably not in Belarus. I think the main implication of a removal from Belarus will be that Putin will not be that he makes a direct attack on Kyiv. But he has plenty of other options.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding his publicized removal of troops, well, that was a train moving across the bridge he built to connect Crimea with Russia proper. While this was a sort of pullback, the message about Crimea on that is pretty clear. Crimea is part of Russia, period.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I do not know where this is going, and it sure is not clear from Russian media, where they continue happy talk about the Olympics, although those are about to end, as well as doing things like showing various Ukrainian comedians on TV. Really.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what might Putin take?  Obviously there is the possibility of a bunch of deals about where various weapons might be, but so far he seems not to be interested in them much. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course the item he has made the most noise about has probably been keeping Ukraine out of NATO.  Well, this is not a simple matter.  Zelensky ran on having a referendum on joining NATO, but he has not done it and probably will not.  The problem is a referendum raises the problem of whether or not the Donbas republics vote or not. Keeping them out would aid a pro-join-NATO vote, but keeping them out would accept that they are not part of Ukraine, which is also not a go.  Zelensky has said \&quot;maybe joining NATO is just a dream,\&quot; and it has been loudly and repeatedly stated by many that Ukraine will not be joining NATO any time soon. But Putin does not seem to have accepted that, while it does not seem at all likely or even politically possible for Zelensky to make any sort of definite promise Ukraine will never join NATO.  This difficult issue does not seem to offer much for Putin.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That leaves the long running matter of the Donbas republics. Increasingly I think this may be where something might be provided for Putin.  In contrast to South Ossetia et al, Russia has not recognized the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk. There has been a stalemate militarily, although recently Ukraine scared them by using Turkish supplied drones.  It is my suspicion that this is what got Putin going with all this.  The \&quot;solution\&quot; to this situation was supposed to be the Minsk Accords, but neither side has implemented them: Putin has not stopped militarily supporting the republics, and Ukraine has not granted the republics the degree of autonomy called for in them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So the lower Duma has voted to formally recognize their independence and have called on Putin to do it.  Maybe this is it, the thing that will give him something for an out.  Recognize them and arm them sufficiently to offset the drones. That will make a mess of the Minsk Accords and will take away from Ukraine, if not necessarily \&quot;wreck\&quot; them. Heck, he could even support them grabbing a bit more territory in spots, just to emphasize the recognition of their independence. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, this is how I see it now, with this matter maybe the best out.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396632,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Barkley Rosser&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 23:33:47&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I am seeing reports of some aggressive shelling coming out of the Donbas republics.  A virtue from Putin&#039;s standpoint of focusing on them, especially for engaging in territorial expansion, is that Putin can engage in plausible deniability, little green men and all that, with this allowing him to avoid suffering from new economic sanctions. It has not been said by anybody so far, but I do think he wants to avoid having the posed sanctions imposed on him, especially a cutoff from the SWIFT system.  That would hurt many of his cronies a lot, so I think he will try to avoid that in whatever it is that he does. But that does push him more towards working through the Donbas republics to engage in whatever \&quot;wrecking\&quot; he does.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396632]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396569,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Some Guy&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 18:43:33&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Why would he not want territory?

So he is sulking angrily around the edges.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396476,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sergey Aleksashenko&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 15:18:36&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;What Putin&#039;s doing, it&#039;s not about Ukraine and the future of this country. Putin is scared of the West and wants to negotiate Russia&#039;s security (how he sees it). For many years his requests were not considered as essential   but finally, approaching his 70th birthday, he found how to blackmail the West - Ukraine is the West&#039;s  \&quot;sore callus\&quot;, pressing it Putin gets attention&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396421,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Dan Hanson&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 13:46:16&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I suspect that we are making category errors analyzing Putin\&quot;s motives, just as we did with Saddam.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Analysta in Western Democracies tend to analyze the behaviour of non-democratic leaders  like Putin as if they are normal democratic politicians with similar motivations and incentives as their own politicians might have.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But these non-democratic regimes are opaque and external behaviour is  often driven by internal politics and power struggles.

A relevant question is whether Putin has been, and continues to be committed to an expanded invasion of Ukraine, or whether he\u2019s running a bluff and is looking to extract significant concessions without actually doing much.  Alternatively, maybe his main goal is to make a demonstration: after all, the mere fact that Russia has demonstrated its ability to mass a big, credible invasion army in Eastern Europe is quite an accomplishment, and sends an important strategic message.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. One problem with finding a diplomatic solution to this crisis is that Russia hasn\u2019t actually done anything other than buildup troops, make threats, and launch cyber attacks.  Consequently, if Ukraine, NATO and America give away a lot in response, they would be providing positive feedback for three, easily replicable, negative tactics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396593,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;w&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 20:16:06&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;There are more than the binary options you present in you point #1.

Such an alliance would allow it to take a much more aggressive stance with the US. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But... how does it benefit China to get involved in World War III over Mexico. It doesn&#039;t. So the policy recommendation to China is 1) don&#039;t get involved in which you don&#039;t have a vested interest. A further recommendation would be that 2) if you&#039;re a true friend of Mexico, you shouldn&#039;t give them false hope that you&#039;re going to come to their rescue, and remind them that no matter how much China might sympathize with Mexico, Mexico is the country that has to live next to its much more powerful neighbor, and is likely to be on the worse end of a conflict.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In turn, this would likely mean that Mexico has to a more conciliatory stance even in the face of US aggression.  The Mexican dream of reclaiming Baja California (and killing or chasing off the sizable number of bootlicking gringo collaborators) will be dashed. On the other hand, by giving this up, the large sections of Mexico that are now armed and wholly unfriendly to bootlicking gringo collaborators won&#039;t be at risk of being bombed back into the Stone Age since there won&#039;t be a war.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sometimes life isn&#039;t fair.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The US hasn&#039;t followed recommendation 2. We&#039;ve spent a decade holding out the carrot of a defensive alliance that was obviously never going to come. At this point, we&#039;ve basically now said, \&quot;You guys goofed up by trusting us\&quot;. At the same time, and the Ukrainians should know better than to expect anyone else to save them when a confrontation comes. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At this point, on the brink of war, what probably needs to happen is a come to Jesus talk with the Ukrainians to get them to concede to implement the Minsk agreement that they hate but already agreed to. With the Russians, you concede the obvious that Ukraine is never going to be in Nato, but you leave all sorts of ways of making life difficult for Russia on the table if they don&#039;t reach agreement and go to war.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396724,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;ivvenalis&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 09:22:57&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:5,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The US isn&#039;t going to \&quot;get involved\&quot; in a war between Russia and Ukraine beyond what it&#039;s already done for the last few years which is sell them weapons and provide some minimal assistance.

If Russia chooses to not just sit idly by while we arm Ukraine, they might try shooting down our planes (or attacking ships or trucks that cross the border into Ukraine). I think it&#039;s obvious that this chain of events makes US\/UK escalation more likely. Maybe Russia shoots down a US plane. Maybe the US does nothing, but maybe US responds with a no fly zone. Maybe this results in US and Russian pilots literally doing battle. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems clear that we&#039;re more likely to get into a conflict that we&#039;re actively arming one side (which, in practice makes us a legitimate target in wartime) than we are to getting into a conflict where we&#039;re telling everyone to step back and be reasonable.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397751,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;M&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 06:50:58&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:9,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Making Ukraine more likely to resist makes Russia more likely to invade...?

Make an invasion today as expensive as possible, and if that&#039;s successful, continue to arm the Ukrainians even more heavily, with more training and sophisticated weaponry. With a sufficiently armed and trained Ukrainian military--one capable of resisting Russian aggression--Nato membership becomes partly a moot point, which means that in a few years, Nato membership becomes a possibility.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The key is making an invasion so onerous for the Russians that success would require the kind of military action that Putin would shy away from--bombing Kiev from the air, for example. Should he do that, WW II style, then the lap-dog Germans would have no choice but to cut off purchases of his gas--which is likely beyond what he is planning for. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Germans, this is what shutting down nuclear reactors looks like...&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396714,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;MikeDC&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:49:21&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:6,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;This sounds great on paper, so why didn&#039;t it happen?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. The German \&quot;lap-dogs\&quot; are actually NATO members and want no part of arming Ukraine to the teeth because it&#039;s quite evident that would lead to the scenario you&#039;re talking about. They&#039;d object... just like they actually have and continue to object to even moderate arming of Ukraine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. It&#039;s not clear that the Ukrainian military can be sufficiently armed and trained. If this was taking place, it would simply have moved the invasion date forward (Putin&#039;s not a moron, if the US were, say, giving Ukraine a missile defense system in June 2020, he&#039;d plan his attack for May 2020. Part of the reason for confrontation seems to be that Russia believes its chances of getting what it wants fall in the future. A move to heavily arm Ukraine would just move this timeline up.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. There&#039;s a non-zero chance that Ukraine uses that military might to wage a war against its breakaway provinces that we wouldn&#039;t agree with. On that subject, Minsk was, literally, agreed to by the principles. Calling it a capitulation and repudiating it would seem to bring us back to the status quo.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. There&#039;s a significantly more than non-zero chance this all blows up into a much higher risk catastrophe. Perhaps in light of Ukraine getting overt military support and abandoning Minsk, maybe Putin doesn&#039;t shy away from bombing Kiev back into the Stone Age. Or accidentally loosing a few missiles at the Nato staging bases in Bulgaria and Romania.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s easy to imagine a future in which this kind of escalation on our side is met with escalation by Russia as well. With the end result being that NATO gets wholly destroyed and there&#039;s a widespread serious war.

I also don&#039;t think it&#039;s credible that we&#039;ll convince the population of Central Europe to go without heating for the rest of the winter, so I don&#039;t even think the threat of sanctions are credible. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Concretely revealing US impotence in the face of Russian action is a win for Russia.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396471,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Lord Action&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 15:10:32&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:5,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I might agree with you that the sanctions threat is a bluff.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bluff means threatening an action without planning to back it up if you&#039;re called on it.  We are conspicuously not doing that with our armed forces.  Our force posture is utterly non-threatening.

Instead we&#039;re doing the bare minimum to tell the weaker NATO states we won&#039;t abaondon them if Russia is more ambitious than we think they are.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The \&quot;cry wolf\&quot; strategy is a weird one, but it&#039;s not an aggressive move.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396525,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;MikeDC&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 16:26:30&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:6,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t quite understand what you&#039;re saying either. Let me try to restate as simply as possible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. Whether the US is currently saying it will fight for Ukraine is less important than the fact that the US has positioned itself as an openly supportive ally of Ukraine. In the past, the US has suggested NATO membership for Ukraine, which implies it would fight for it. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. This is all a blow to US prestige, is it not? And it&#039;s a blow to the value of US friendship if it can&#039;t stop Ukraine from being invaded. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. To some extent, this is already done, because the mere threat of Russian invasion seems to have slammed the door on NATO expansion.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. But... I think Russia going in and taking what they want in Ukraine over ineffectual US protest obviously adds further embarrassment and makes Russia look relatively stronger and the US look relatively weaker. Which is, itself, a victory for Russia.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396531,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Lord Action&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 16:40:58&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:7,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. The U.S. has very clearly stated that they are not an ally of Ukraine, have no treaty obligation with Ukraine, and will not be coming to the rescue.  They have clearly demonstrated that by deploying their forces in a manner that, while maybe reassuring to weak NATO partners, can&#039;t do anything about Russian intentions in Ukraine.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Talk is cheap.  Yes, everyone outside Russia is unhappy about a democracy potentially being invaded by a dictatorship.  We&#039;ll moan and groan and maybe try to implement sanctions that won&#039;t accomplish anything.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Well, kind of, yeah.  I mean the U.S. has no commitment to Ukraine and has been pretty clear about that.  We&#039;re trying to use soft power to stop an invasion we view as unjust.  If we wanted to stop Russia militarily, I won&#039;t argue it would be trivial, but it would be well-within our power to do so.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. To the contrary, I think that will be the big fallout of this.  Assuming we don&#039;t make a secret agreement to stop an invasion (and I think it would be too high a price to pay to do so), NATO is about to become a lot more attractive.  I&#039;d expect Sweden, where NATO is already fairly popular, to be made an attractive offer.  Heck I&#039;d even expect Finland to seriously consider it.  And losing the Baltic and gaining a bit more of the Black Sea is a bad outcome for Russia.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4. That I&#039;ll buy.

He gets Ukraine, which he really wants. NATO gets... closer ties to Sweden and Finland.

Despite the ongoing conflict in Donbas, Moscow has made no effort to annex actual territory in eastern Ukraine. Rumors have abounded for years about supposed imminent incursions into Belarus or eastern Estonia without coming to fruition. I realize there are examples of rhetorical flourishes Putin has made that draw a lot of emphasis - way too much ink spilled on that one \&quot;greatest geopolitical catastrophe\&quot; line - but most of Russia&#039;s military actions since 2000 have been reactions to exogenous crises.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396589,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Barkley Rosser&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-17 20:10:08&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:4,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;genezip,&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wrong.

In 2008 Georgia did attempt to retake South Ossetia, but failed, with Russian troops then invading Georgia proper to punish them for their effort to reconquer South Ossetia.

The list of attendees includes heads of states, governments and international organizations, ministers, members of parliament, high-ranking representatives of armed forces, science, civil society, as well as business and media.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The conference is held annually in February.
