He was recently named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the last decade and several years ago Bloomberg BusinessWeek dubbed him \"America's Hottest Economist.\" Foreign Policy magazine named him as one of its \"Top 100 Global Thinkers\" of 2011. His next book, about American business, is due out in 2019. He has blogged at Marginal Revolution every day for almost fifteen years.","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/tylercowen"],"url":"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/author/tyler-cowen"}]}</script>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Virginia has gone Republican (temporarily, because of school-related issues), San Francisco recalled its school board by a decisive margin, Joe Rogan wasn&#8217;t cancelled, and there may be a significant war in Ukraine.  That is the theme of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-02-18/wokeism-has-peaked-in-america-but-is-still-globally-influential?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=view&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;sref=htOHjx5Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my latest Bloomberg column</a>.  Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>The turning point for the fortunes of the woke may be this week’s school board <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/us/san-francisco-school-board-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election</a> in San Francisco, where three members were recalled by a margin of more than 70%. Voters were upset that the school board spent time trying to rename some schools in a more politically correct manner, rather than focusing on reopening all the schools. There was also considerable opposition to the board’s introduction of a lottery admissions system for a prestigious high school, in lieu of the previous use of grades and exam scores.</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another trend is how relatively few immigrants are woke. Latinos in particular seem <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/14/opinions/republican-latino-voters-gest/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more open</a> to the Republican Party, or at least <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/have-latinos-really-moved-toward-the-republican-party/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t seem to have</a> strong partisan attachments. More generally, immigrant political views are <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/party-affiliation/by/state/among/immigrant-status/immigrants/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more diverse</a> than many people think, even within the Democratic Party.</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wokeism is likely to evolve into <a href="https://medium.com/science-and-philosophy/woke-lameness-and-toxic-femininity-a38f7e3cb3f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a subculture</a> that is highly educated, highly White and fairly feminine. That is still a large mass of people, but not enough to run the country or all its major institutions. In the San Francisco school board recall, for instance, the role of Asian Americans was especially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/16/us/san-francisco-school-board-recall.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prominent</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition:</p>
<blockquote><p>The woke also are likely to achieve an even greater hold over American universities. Due to the tenure system, personnel turnover is low, and currently newer and younger <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2016/10/03/voter-registration-data-show-democrats-outnumber-republicans-among-social-scientists" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faculty</a> are more left-wing than are older faculty, including in my field of economics. The simple march of retirements is going to make universities even more left-wing — and even more out of touch with mainstream America.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hereby inscribe this prediction in The Book of Tetlock.</p>

It&#039;s a trickle-down process. but it works, and nothing can reverse it except a countermovement of ideas at the top. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is why the world religions&#039; myths perpetuate themselves generation after generation. The relatively adept (priests, teachers) indoctrinate children who go on to be parents who participate in the indoctrination of their own children. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A common error is to assume that there&#039;s some reality check that can reverse this process if the ideas are bad ones. But this ignores the fact that reality is always interpreted through ideational\/ideological lenses. Control education and the media (news and entertainment, low culture, and high culture) and you control how people see reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That doesn&#039;t mean that when this process gets underway, there won&#039;t be political reverses for the hegemonic ideas. Reverses occur because the entire population isn&#039;t evenly educated (in this case, in woke ideas). The woke revolution has thus far mainly affected the ideas of children and recent college graduates, who in turn have seized control of virtually all institutions. But they will sometimes get ahead of their skis, not because reality is disproving their ideas but because their ideas are not yet hegemonic among those who are older, who outnumber the young. But that is just a matter of time. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So optimism triggered by electoral victories is foolish. Elections are lagging indicators because even the undereducated, and the older college educated, can vote. (And even at that, Youngkin nearly lost in Va.!) But the massive woke ideological revolution proceeds to indoctrinate more and more people, regardless of who is the governor of Virginia or the president of the United States.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397353,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Blades&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:3,&quot;vote_count&quot;:4,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 11:04:30&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Boring.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I don\u2019t know many, maybe no, woke people.

It became popular with non-African Americans for a few years after Ferguson but outside of its original African American context is now mostly used to sneer at white progressives for being pretentious and self-righteous bores.  There is no organization of \&quot;the woke\&quot;, no \&quot;woke\&quot; church or party, and no set of agreed upon \&quot;woke\&quot; principles.

I think politics and corporate America are downstream of cultural shifts. The median voter is sick of the excesses of wokism as demonstrated by the elections Tyler mentioned. Democratic politicians have realized this, and are rolling back mask mandates and pursuing other, non woke agendas like refunding police. Corporations, including corporate media, will probably catch on next. If this is peak woke, there will be a long tail as those who went along with wokeism to be \u201ccool\u201d and \u201cforward thinking\u201d slowly adjust. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for identify politics, that only works when white men are the common enemy. White men will over time eventually be less disproportionally in positions of power and the other races and genders will catch up. Asians are already breaking away as are Latinos. I project gays are next. Once identity politics dies, the non-white racial coalitions will break up and start fighting amongst themselves and new coalitions will form around things other than race.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396918,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Anti-communist&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:9,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:9,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:9,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 12:45:32&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;That is still a large mass of people, but not enough to run the country or all its major institutions\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How mistaken you are. Every institution is currently predicated on propagating woke ideology. The American Bar Association has now made accreditation contingent on \&quot;commitment to anti-racism.\&quot; Every large corporation has a Diversity, Inclusion, Equity (DIE) branch of their HR, which serves no purpose but to rent-seek and cause racial resentment. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Once you stop viewing woke as a political movement and view it instead as a cult of Marx that replaces class with race, then you will understand that \&quot;woke has peaked,\&quot; is to declare very premature victory.

He is explicitly saying that academia and few other areas will get even more woke. The thing is that society overall is likely to become tired of wokeism and will pay less attention to hyperwoke institutions (media, academia, federal agencies). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I share this view and think that we are moving towards Big Divergence. Some parts of society will get hyperwoke, while the rest will simply walk away. Media consumption will move from legacy media to podcasts\/substacks or something entirely new. Online education will slowly replace universities and maybe even K-12. In business nobody outside HR departments and few tech firms will care about wokeism.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397077,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;OldCurmudgeon&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 16:10:03&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In business nobody outside HR departments and few tech firms will care about wokeism.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;It&#039;s over Anakin!

Unlike places like academia, corporate world is still mostly meritocratic and results-driven. Firms, which go too far in woke craze will end up attracting workers who will never get anything done. In business world, there is strong pressure to deliver results. Firms, which cannot deliver, will lose market share and go out of business. It is that simple. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, this argument does not apply to parts of business world, where generating outrage is a business model. That&#039;s why I think that legacy media will go even further in woke rabbit hole. The thing is that fewer and fewer people will care about them anyway.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397135,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;OldCurmudgeon&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 19:17:57&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;In business world, there is strong pressure to deliver results.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;YMMV.  De facto, managers control corporate assets, not the shareholders.  And the managers mostly care mostly about their standing with the global elite...as they will have moved on to a different role in 2-3 years, long before the consequences of their decisions are apparent.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IMHO, the managers used to have more skin-in-the-game back when most of their compensation came via 5 year vesting options.

And, contrary to popular belief, HR makes these decisions mostly to create a paper trail so that, if the company gets sued, they have a very strong defense and can get the case dismissed or settled for a small amount.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397213]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397135,160397213]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397109,160397135,160397213]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396963,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Christopher Johnson&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 13:26:20&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, I think this is an accurate take.

What are some recent numbers (lifetime births per woman \/ 2.1 is \&quot;replacement\&quot; level): USA 1.59; Scandinavia ~1.55; England 1.52; Scotland 1.32; Australia 1.64; Japan 1.3; South Korea 0.82, every one on a downward trend. Fertility among US-born Asian Americans, the most highly educated ethnicity in the US, was all the way down to about 1.3 births per woman in 2020 and likely fell another 0.05 or so since. See the @BirthGauge twitter feed for a huge trove of birth and fertility data.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is not a separate phenomenon but is tightly connected with wokeism:&lt;br \/&gt;\n* Political affiliation has become extremely correlated with fertility: See&lt;br \/&gt;\nhttps:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/pressroom\/sosmap\/fertility_rate\/fertility_rates.htm (choose 2020 as the year to get the latest data)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;https:\/\/www.aei.org\/articles\/the-conservative-fertility-advantage\/&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But this didn&#039;t used to be so true in the past. Before the leftist cultural revolution of the last few decades, fertility of Democrats and Republicans were much more similar.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* Some 21% of generation Z identifies as LGBT, up from 4% of gen X, 2.6% of boomers and 0.8% of pre-boomers (!!)&lt;br \/&gt;\nhttps:\/\/news.gallup.com\/poll\/389792\/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx&lt;br \/&gt;\nThat surely is manifesting in the collapsing fertility rates we are seeing concentrated in the youngest cohorts. (Links are necessary because this seems unbelievable.) &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So the most significant effect of the cultural triumph of leftism is not wokeism but something much deeper, a dramatic collapse fertility (which we have seen is tightly tied to political affiliation).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And the effect of fertility driven demographic collapse may be the stiffest economic and civilizational headwind history has seen. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;(Even Korea&#039;s extreme fertility collapse is related to similar cultural shifts: religiosity in Korea has sharply declined and no country has more completely absorbed Western pop-culture -- to the point where Korea has become a leading exporter in that market.)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396858,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Mark Z&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:9,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:10,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:11,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 12:04:39&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ve ever seen a more obviously wrong prediction in my life.

I base this off everything I have seen in my relatively short lifetime so far. Every conservative prediction I have ever seen about the left \&quot;eating their own\&quot;, liberals going too far, a right wing backlash, or some kind of peak progressivism have never actually panned out. The left continues to double down and basically most Democrats have always just gone along with it and they gradually get more progressive. Ask yourself honestly in what way is the median\/mean liberal less progressive on any issue relative to the median\/mean liberal in 1980, 2000, or even 2015? Especially on issues of culture and social policy. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt; If you told me back in 2010 or 2012 that feminists would be pushing to make sure naked men could walk around women&#039;s locker rooms I would have stared at you blank faced and shocked. Feminists are now diligently urging that pre-operation transpeople born as males but who identify as female must be given access to women&#039;s private spaces. There appears to be no sign that women are suddenly going to become conservatives and try to ban this.

I fully expected the demands of feminism to *automatically* lead to their swift re-opening. I&#039;ve thought about how I could have been so wrong about that. Mostly, I suppose, I failed to reckon with the teachers, a huge block of women, pushing in the other direction. I may have been misled by long residence in an \&quot;excellent\&quot; school district where the veteran teachers at least, actually seemed to enjoy hanging out with kids, benignly - if not brilliantly - ruling their little classroom fiefdoms.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I also think that if it weren&#039;t for the use of screens in education - if parents [or the subset of fairly conscientious parents] had had to open textbooks and go through lessons and compel finished assignments, with their kids - that it never would have gone as far as it did.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It does seem like the start of a breach in the hegemony of public school. Some groups made it plain they could turn their backs completely on education - and I don&#039;t expect the Asian-Americans who demand the most of public school, to exercise any paternalism in that regard. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am a product of an indifferent public school education. Still, it would have been easy to defend the idea of public school, for the average kid, when I attended. I sometimes asked to go to private school - I remember this reached an acute stage when my friend across the street was playing the Fox in a French-language production of the \&quot;Little Prince\&quot; at her Catholic girls&#039; school; I was also captivated by the ways those girls despite uniforms subtly altered or accessorized their appearance to maintain a hierarchy of fashionableness - and my mother would reply that public school reflected the \&quot;real world\&quot;, which prepared you for real life. (\&quot;Prepared for it to suck!\&quot; I now see was the obvious rejoinder to this piety, but I wasn&#039;t so coarse then.) &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now, who will defend it? Where it occasionally functions - magnet schools - it&#039;s attacked. When it attempts to restore an orderliness that would make regular schools at least more closely resemble those elite schools, reducing the obvious gap between them, it&#039;s attacked. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The hegemony of public school has been breached, just a little, in some way. It feels like some groups may turn their backs completely on education - and I don&#039;t expect Asian-Americans who demand the most of school, to exercise any paternalism in that regard, nor, with as much fervor as they once would have, liberal whites, who&#039;ve had it placed in their minds that there&#039;s an alternative, even if it was messy and ill-executed during the pandemic.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Don&#039;t be so quick to get rid of football, if you love the idea of American public school.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396976]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396884,160396976]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396782,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;steve&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-8,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:9,&quot;downboops&quot;:17,&quot;vote_count&quot;:26,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 10:59:01&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I think this is probably correct.

Is the information theory or distributive theory or party-centered theory of committee organization in Congress more accurate? Is lobbying vote-buying, information signaling, or legislative subsidy?

And if you are wanting to fight the partisan fight, then let loose once you get tenure.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, you&#039;ll be one of only a few Republicans in your grad program. And yes, if you turn everything into a partisan fight, your colleagues will be annoyed with you, but it&#039;s not impossible to get through the gauntlet by being civil and biting your tongue every now and then. Along the way, you&#039;ll learn that a lot of the professors have beef with wokeism gone wild. Indeed, you may also find some fellow conservatives. But if you&#039;re going to tell women that they should suck it up and pursue higher paying jobs and stop whining about the gender gap in pay, then put on your big boy pants and do the same, and it would be better for higher education in the end if you did so.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397056,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;steve&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:4,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 15:37:17&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Totally agree with you.

You now must justify the DEI aspect for admissions into graduate program, for grants, for jobs, and for publications. There&#039;s an enormous excess of interest and very few slots at every stage, so that creates plenty of cut points for those with wrongthink to get filtered out. And it&#039;s getting worse every year.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even if you succeed in scaling those hurdles and enter the academy as a professor, there are land mines and litmus tests everywhere, everyday. It&#039;s no longer just good enough to be friendly and avoid \&quot;partisan fight,\&quot; it&#039;s \&quot;you must be actively anti-racist at all stages or else.\&quot; Hope that you put your land acknowledgements on your syllabi, conduct DEI audits of all the citations in your papers, state your pronouns at every meeting, and sign on to every petition from the liberal groups on campus, and make sure you do it with a smile and genuine enthusiasm! And even then, that may not be enough if you aren&#039;t countable as a POC by the racial bean-counters who increasingly run everything; perhaps they need a few more white people to fail tenure review to even-out the numbers. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, those \&quot;moderate liberals\&quot; who secretly don&#039;t like wokeism will be the first to turn on you publicly.

Until conservative politicians get their heads out of the ground and learn how to effectively handle the academy (hint: overbroad anti-CRT laws are not going to be effective when every person in HR, the admin, and hiring committees is \&quot;committed to anti-racist hiring practices\&quot;), it&#039;s a recipe for disaster.

Evidence from State Adoption of Right-to-Work Laws\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The distribution of income lies at the intersection of states and markets, both influencing and responding to government policy. Reflecting this reality, increasing research focuses on the political origins of inequality in the United States. However, the literature largely assumes\u2014rather than tests\u2014the political mechanisms thought to affect the income gap. This study provides a timely reassessment of one such mechanism. Leveraging variation in labor laws between states and differences in the timing of adoption of right-to-work (RTW) legislation, I examine one political mechanism blamed by many for contributing to inequality. Using a variety of panel designs, I find little evidence that RTW laws have been a major cause of growing income inequality, pointing to the importance of grounding theoretical arguments about the interrelationships between states and markets in a sound empirical reality.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;https:\/\/www.cambridge.org\/core\/journals\/state-politics-and-policy-quarterly\/article\/abs\/do-antiunion-policies-increase-inequality-evidence-from-state-adoption-of-righttowork-laws\/D6F32ECC9D7B0D576224F9A41FABDC61&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396955,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;aMichael&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 13:21:22&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Counterpoint:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Obstacles to Estimating Voter ID Laws\u2019 Effect on Turnout\&quot;&lt;br \/&gt;\nWidespread concern that voter identification laws suppress turnout among racial and ethnic minorities has made empirical evaluations of these laws crucial. But problems with administrative records and survey data impede such evaluations. We replicate and extend Hajnal, Lajevardi, and Nielson\u2019s 2017 article, which concludes that voter ID laws decrease turnout among minorities, using validated turnout data from five national surveys conducted between 2006 and 2014. We show that the results of their article are a product of data inaccuracies, the presented evidence does not support the stated conclusion, and alternative model specifications produce highly variable results. When errors are corrected, one can recover positive, negative, or null estimates of the effect of voter ID laws on turnout, precluding firm conclusions.

Interviewed at a top 10 place. A top 20 and couple competing to be in the top 20. No diversity statement required, but I don&#039;t know why that matters. They all know my race, ethnicity, and gender (white dude), so if that helps or hurts, it doesn&#039;t matter whether I submit a diversity statement, too.  If someone wanted to guess my politics, it wouldn&#039;t be hard to do so given my work experience, which was on my resume. Plus, if they cared enough and asked my advisers, they&#039;d know a bit, too, but I don&#039;t think anyone asked because that&#039;s not how it works.  Political scientists doing quantitative work are apolitical in many ways and eccentric in their policy views. We generally think both parties suck though the majority agree that the Republican party sucks more, but it turns out that there some Republicans on some of the search committees at these places. I&#039;m not saying that to say they snuck me in or something. I&#039;m just saying that there&#039;s more diversity than people realize. The picture people paint in the comments here is based on the extreme cases. And sure, if I came into the interview and said things like \&quot;Lefties are crazy, amirite?\&quot; They wouldn&#039;t hire me. But why would I do that? I wouldn&#039;t even hire someone who did that because I&#039;d question their decision-making skills on all sorts of levels. Again, I said conservatives should pursue PhD&#039;s. I didn&#039;t say they should do that AND offend all of their partisan enemies while they did it. Have some discretion, people. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;P.S. At most jobs, you don&#039;t go around spouting all of your political views to all your coworkers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397167,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Mark Z&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:4,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:4,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:4,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 21:28:58&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:5,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;At my job (quasi-academic, institutional rather than research), my leftist co-workers do go around spouting all their views to their co-workers. My previous boss occasionally went on unhinged anti-white rants, and flat out asked me who I voted for in a meeting. I would have to be a moron to admit to holding right of center political views in that context.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#039;ve known a decent amount of humanists\/social scientists, especially in grad school. The majority were socialists, the rest progressives; I never knew a single Republican or libertarian. I don&#039;t doubt they exist, but they don&#039;t talk about it. Note that there have been enough verified instances of academics being sanctioned or fired for opposing affirmative action even in the politest terms that I don&#039;t know how anyone can still deny it happens. This is such obvious gaslighting, insisting that if you suffer consequences for right of center views it must be because you were being deliberately offensive.

There appear to be the same req&#039;s for other UC schools.  Do you think the UC system is outlier?  Do you think that a diversity statement that described your commitment to Liberal enlightenment values of treating all equally regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender would pass muster?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; if I came into the interview and said things like \&quot;Lefties are crazy, amirite?\&quot; They wouldn&#039;t hire me&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sure.  But what if you came in with a history of participating in conservative or libertarian organizations?  Or is making sure there&#039;s nothing like that on your record (or discoverable by a Google search) all part of having some discretion?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397112,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;aMichael&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 17:57:35&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:6,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I forgot about your last point.

I think it would also depend on which organizations you&#039;ve been working with. Libertarian stuff is fine. General conservative thinktanks are probably fine. More direct work with the Trump campaign would be a big ding. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d love seeing work with Turning Point USA.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But my advice is to do high quality social science work. That&#039;s the top factor in landing a job in the social sciences. Work your butt off and get those paper published. And again, there are so many things you could publish on that are orthogonal to politics and wokeism.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397105,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;aMichael&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 17:46:16&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:6,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m well aware of the diversity statement that&#039;s required at all UC schools now. I&#039;m not sure how widespread it is beyond the UC system, and I&#039;m not sure if it will catch on more because it&#039;s mostly cheap talk and anyone with a PhD should be able to put something together that doesn&#039;t offend administrators. What you wrote is a few steps below shouting out \&quot;Lefties are crazy, amirite!,\&quot; and I wouldn&#039;t recommend someone do that. You might say that&#039;s evidence that the woke have taken over academia, and I wouldn&#039;t disagree with you, but my point was that more conservatives should pursue PhD&#039;s AND be successful at it. Spitting in the faces of your future employer isn&#039;t going to help achieve that if your goal is to change things in the long term.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, I don&#039;t see the diversity statement as very problematic.

The result is a surge in Asian ethnic solidarity, little focus on the negative fruits of woke DA policies or on misbehavior by black people, and an ideological attack on a group- white conservatives- that are largely sympathetic to Asians and have nothing whatsoever to do with the crimes in question.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Expect to see more mental gymnastics tricks like this going forward.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397035,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Luka&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:24,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:26,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:28,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 14:58:51&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:4,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The same thing essentially happened with anti-Semitic and transphobic attacks somewhat recently.

They&#039;re not going to push back much against it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The new Boston mayor Michelle Wu is a great example of this dynamic.

Personally, I think most Asian Americans are relatively conformist and being so inundated with our left leaning education system they probably feel compelled to support preferential policies for people they are told to. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Honestly, for non-Latino White Americans their best bet might be to just give up on elite colleges and send their kids to mid level state and private universities where they can get just as good an education as the Ivy League ones for a much lower price.
