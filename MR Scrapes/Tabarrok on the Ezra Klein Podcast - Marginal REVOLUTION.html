  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Late last year I responded to an <a href="https://twitter.com/ezraklein/status/1468717211170721795?s=20">excellent tweet storm</a> from Ezra Klein by in effect saying he should read Mancur Olson&#8217;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rise-Decline-Nations-Stagflation-Rigidities/dp/0300030797/ref=sr_1_1&amp;tag=marginalrevol-20">The Rise and Decline of Nations</a>. And you know what? He did! Ezra then kindly invited me on to his <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/18/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-alex-tabarrok.html">New York Times podcast</a> to discuss public choice, liberalism, and the rise and decline of nations.</p>
<p>A few good quotes from me:</p>
<blockquote><p>Japan has caught up to us in slowing down.</p></blockquote>
<p>And</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me put it in a way that progressives can understand, there is an inequality of voice and that inequality of voice also goes to the rich and the powerful and the people who can hire lawyers and the people who can use these so-called equitable institutions to their advantage&#8212;even the people in the marginalized communities have not benefited.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ezra asked challenging questions and had lots of interesting things to say. I was especially struck by his argument that people want to tell heroic stories about themselves and so rent seeking comes to be redefined as something heroic. I think that&#8217;s an important insight which public choice scholars are likely to overlook&#8211;it becomes harder and harder to break out of a rent-seeking equilibrium not just because of transitional gains traps and the like but because the equilibrium <a href="https://econfaculty.gmu.edu/klein/PdfPapers/IfGovtVill.pdf">comes to be seen as virtuous</a>.</p>
<p>You also get to hear me rant about new hiring procedures at GMU and my HOA.</p>
<p>Ezra asks a good question about why developer interest groups don&#8217;t dominate the planning process.</p>
<p>We also talk about crypto and decentralized consensus as well as other topics.</p>
<p>Whether you call it state capacity libertarianism, creating the innovation nation, or supply side progressivism, I think this movement, which Ezra is leading from the left, is one of the most important movements today.</p>

The discussions about GMU\u2019s recently expanded, diversified and committee-fied hiring, as well as Alex\u2019s HOA battle to get a flat Falling Water-style roof on his house, were fascinating.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\u201cWe [as opposed to Mancur Olson\u2019s prediction of interest groups] are largely doing this to ourselves,\u201d he says, about enlarging and empowering vetocracy, and focusing more on redistribution &amp;amp; rent-seeking that production and innovation. Who exactly \u201cwe\u201d is dovetails with:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alex\u2019s ballsy (for a NYT podcast) admission that feminization via democratization \/ giving everyone a voice is behind much of our stultification.&lt;br \/&gt;\nAlex\u2019s (and Ezra\u2019s?) almost wistful talk of Churchill\u2019s fast-acting coordination during the German blitz.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Action without representation beats representation without action.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397552,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Rex Edwards&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 18:27:44&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The one Achillea&#039;s heal in HOAs is rational ignorance, everyone wants someone else to do the work and to participate. In over two decades of experience, I found only one person willing to take the time to get training (Community Association Institute). It is a huge task to get anyone to even just serve. Naturally ignorant or even venal people may serve. The result is Florida condos and petty payoffs. It is quite an ego trip to see a place go from a bankrupt drug dealer-ridden place to a moderately valuable property with a reasonable financial reserve in a decade. But, it is a matter of serendipity to find several public-spirited people who will invest time, some personal risk, and organize a coalition to do so. When higher government attempts to \&quot;reform\&quot; HOAs it imposes much higher costs and effort on the process. The problems with HOAs simply reflect our own character or the lack of it. We have met the enemy and it is us. Even in more affluent communities, we as the kids say, suck..&lt;br \/&gt;\nTwenty plus year veteran&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397549,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;spad&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 18:24:41&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;@alex Would you favor a wealth tax to fund all defense spending?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397576,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;David B&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 19:45:47&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;What is the point of this question? Wealth taxes have been largely abandoned (except for local property taxes and estate and gift taxes) because they generate a lot of avoidance and little revenue; in short, they score badly on both efficiency and adequacy grounds. How would dedicating such taxes to defense spending make them better - even assuming that they could be dedicated? And how is this scheme supposed to work? Is the idea to constrain defense spending to whatever level wealth taxes can fund? Or to justify raising wealth taxes to whatever level is required by defense spending? And suppose wartime exigencies require a massive temporary increase in defense spending; in this (hopefully unlikely) scenario, would wealth taxes also have to be jacked up - regardless of optimality?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397576]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397507,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Donald Pretari&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 15:46:03&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;In this country, if you want to drive legally, you must purchase insurance. In no sense is this onerous or socialist. My politics derive from Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, Madison, John Randolph, Lincoln, Henry Simons, Frank Knight, Oakeshott, Hayek, Churchill, Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, none of whom are leftists. I can actually point to the place where I  got my policies from. One position all my heroes have is an extreme distaste for ideology and ideologues, which is pretty much all I read now including from people who comment on this blog. A classic liberal is someone who has a preference for small government on all levels, but who doesn&#039;t waste time and energy pretending there needn&#039;t be any government. I&#039;ll give you a classic liberal position about helping the poor in rough neighborhoods. You can influence IQ and abilities but it takes an incredible amount of money and serious govrvhjvrnment n intervention into family life. So you spend some money on the problem and try pragmatically to make the best use of the money you can reasonably adress the problem with. Classic liberals are never nationalists or defenders of tariffs, for example. Clinton versus Trump and Trump versus Biden are from a classic liberal point of view a ship seriously off course.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397511,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Donald Pretari&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 15:48:51&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;...serious government intervention into family life...&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397511]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397504,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;WB&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 15:37:12&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;This was a brilliant conversation. Really enjoyable, really thought provoking!&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I found one moment perplexing. It&#039;s one that others have noted in the comments, namely the moment when Alex argues in the interview, \&quot;To get money out of politics, you have to get politics out of money.\&quot; He then says, as a follow-up, that he&#039;s being somewhat facetious or simplistic (I can&#039;t remember the exact wording now).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m confused Even if Alex is making this claim somewhat facetiously, it suggests either a very unorthodox understanding of politics or an utterly naive one. If we think of politics as the division of power and resources -- i.e., the process of determining who gets what, when, and how, as Laswell suggested -- then it&#039;s all but impossible to separate money from politics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I suppose the libertarian response is that a smaller government has less resources to gather and divide, which in turn reduces the politics in money. But I think that&#039;s too simple, since even the decision to limit government decisions is ultimately a political one that will produce relative winners and losers. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Genuinely confused here.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397502,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;David B&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:8,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:8,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:8,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 15:30:49&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;One and a half cheers for Ezra Klein reading Mancur Olsen and making a few perceptive observations on it. However, Klein still can&#039;t see beyond his own priors on redistribution: he thinks that using government to seed innovation and then chopping down any business or individual who successfully run with it is some kind of sustainable model for growth, because it will ameliorate the inequality that Klein thinks is the root of current low levels of trust in both markets and government. By this tortured logic, appeasing and amplifying populist resentments becomes a means of sating them, while demonizing and punishing innovators becomes a means of incentivizing them. When has this ever been the case? That&#039;s why, contra Alex, I view \&quot;supply side progressivism\&quot; as a nonstarter - a bit of rhetorical hand waving ultimately no more coherent than MMT.&lt;br \/&gt;\nI also think that Klein has not really grasped the import of public choice arguments about the sorts of people and behavior that \u201cbig government\u201d elicits. Klein quotes Olson saying that \u201cthe incentive to produce is diminished. The incentive to seek a larger share of what is produced increases. The reward for pleasing those to whom we sell our goods or labor declines, while the reward for evading or exploiting regulations, politics, and bureaucracy, and for asserting our rights through bargaining or complex understandings becomes great.\u201d To see where this leads, I think one needs to go beyond Olsen to Janos Kornai\u2019s insights about \u201ceconomies of shortage\u201d and \u201csoft budget constraints\u201d; perhaps Klein\u2019s next reading assignment should be Kornai\u2019s \u201cGrowth, Shortage and Efficiency: A Macrodynamic Model of the Socialist Economy\u201d or \u201cDynamism, Rivalry, and the Surplus Economy: Two Essays on the Nature of Capitalism.\u201d Of course the so-called centrally planned economy is an extreme case. But I suggest that the sclerotic state capitalist economy is symptomatic of where \&quot;supply side progressivism\&quot; ends up. How do we stop short of flying too close to the sun? Will we know we\u2019ve flown to high only when we find ourselves plummeting earthward with our wings burnt off?&lt;br \/&gt;\nFinally, about renters NIMBY. There have been some good comments on this point. I would only add as a general observation a caution against characterizing property rights in pure black-and-white terms, i.e. owners have all the rights, tenants have none. Even where housing markets remain relatively unregulated this is not the case, because of necessarily incomplete contracting (cf. Alchian, Coase, Demsitz, Hart, Williamson, etc.). So it is not really surprising that renters should see neighborhood (\u201cbackyard\u201d) amenities as part of the bundle of informal rights they have acquired with their lease.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398742,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;BeefWellington3rd&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-22 01:57:44&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;David, I haven&#039;t read Olson.

New apartment blocks built down the street does not lead to a lowering of their own rent by 10% or whatever.  Best case is that it leads to lower and slower rental increases in the future.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the other hand,  new construction leads directly to more people in the near future.  Which means increased congestion, a heavier burden on infrastructure.  More demand for public services.   And an increase in public disorder, which is highly correlated to increased density. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The net result is an immediate negative impact on the quality of life for the renters.  Counterbalance by a theoretical benefit of lower rent costs years into the future.   At which point many of the renters will have moved anyway.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So looking at the whole picture, it is entirely rational for renters to oppose new construction near them and irrational for them to support it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397358,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Millian&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:4,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:7,&quot;downboops&quot;:3,&quot;vote_count&quot;:10,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 11:16:30&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m a little disappointed that Alex is buying the Thiel line about women being the problem.

IE greed or corruption.  With the broader definition just meaning an equivalent of motivation.   &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alex focuses on the financial aspect and goes into 2nd and 3rd order effects to demonstrate his point.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;IMO a better response would be that money is just a means to an end.  Self interest can be temporally focused on acquiring money to affect an ultimate end.  But it is the ultimate end that motivates the self interest.  And money is not the only way to the end.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, people that want to live in a specific type of community can achieve that end by acquiring money and moving to such a community.   Or they could get the government to use compulsion to achieve that type of community.  Both are self interest motivated to s specific goal.

(See research on Dictator Game, etc. and research on group punishment).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here is the transcript, and the retreat where they are talking about how meetings have gotten larger to accommodate more views:  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ALEX TABARROK: Well, I think, frankly, it\u2019s become more feminized. The virtues have shifted towards the feminine side of the spectrum, if I can be politically incorrect. Like safety, safety is a big one, right? So anything you can justify in terms of safety or justify in terms of the children \u2014 we\u2019re doing it for the children \u2014 that\u2019s a big one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Fairness is another one \u2014 equality in access, in speaking, all of these kinds of things. Like, everybody has to be heard, that kind of fairness. That\u2019s one of the reasons just for having meetings is so that you give everybody an opportunity to be heard.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Well, that\u2019s fine, but that means that we have to hear from a lot more people, and things get slowed down. So to the extent that people frame their lives and careers in terms of heroic virtues, those virtues have shifted towards the more feminine side, as opposed to the Howard Roark, you\u2019re going to build it my way, or I\u2019m going to blow it up, right? It doesn\u2019t get much play anymore.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;EZRA KLEIN: But when you put it like that, I think people can hear that as offensive, but you could also hear it as actually a good and overdue correction. A society that cares about children, a society that wants to make sure it\u2019s hearing from different people and different kinds of people, a society more concerned about equality. I mean, rather than thinking about this as a disease of prosperity, that makes it sound like an overdue benefit.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;ALEX TABARROK: Yeah, I mean, that is the problem, is that it\u2019s Apollo and Dionysus. There\u2019s arguments for both sides. And the issue is try to find something in the middle perhaps. I think we\u2019ve swung too far. And the evidence for that is precisely that people like yourself, who are thinking about these things more prospectively, see that some of the things you want are becoming impossible because people are paying too much attention to all of these other virtues.\&quot;  https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/02\/18\/podcasts\/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-alex-tabarrok.html&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What is interesting is that in marketing and consumer psychology we recognized the importance of fairness, but for others, fairness appears to be a friction.

Policy has become schizophrenic. There is a real tension between the world we have and the world some of us want. Many conservatives tout local solutions. \&quot;The federal government is captured by industry and state\/local government is better equipped to solve it.\&quot; I agree, but state governments and county governments are also captured by bad actors in their districts.

There is this sense that he could never damage the land you both grew up on and face you with a clear conscious.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The problem of innovation as I see it from working in state government is complex. There is a fear that you might get it wrong and waste taxpayer money or a fear that you will draw the ire of a powerful company or politician. Agencies within states suffer from this twofold problem.  Cities suffer from a additional problem, home rule. Nashville or Memphis want change but the governor can&#039;t be seen tolerating liberal thinking. He would have to endure scolding on Fox News or OAN. The assault on government has produced nihilism and malaise. So we wait.

The pool of governors has notably failed to yield many viable contenders for national office.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Take Texas&#039; Greg Abbott. To you, to the nation, he is perhaps broadly viewed as \&quot;libertarian\&quot;. In practice that plays out in the pettiest of ways. A Texas town passes a heritage-tree ordinance, or a plastic grocery bag ban. A diversity of such local measures across the state might easily be regarded as decentralized and thus \&quot;libertarian\&quot; - and in any case, how small of all that government does, these little measures ... But no: these local matters capture his attention like nothing else.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A case in point: urban sprawl has of course meant that some city streets remain classified as \&quot;state roads\&quot; with, in theory if not so much in practice, state \&quot;maintenance\&quot;. One such purely urban Austin street - rather ugly and a bit of a mess in the way that very wide old highways or farm-to-market roads become haphazardly urbanized - was readying for city improvement, bonds passed, after many years of slow-as-molasses Austin planning - when the governor&#039;s office announced the other day that it was \&quot;taking back\&quot; the road. I don&#039;t know \&quot;why\&quot;. Maybe the word \&quot;bike lane\&quot; triggered him, or pedestrians, or trees, or \&quot;room for future transit\&quot;. It could be any of those things, obviously. The excuse was, you should have asked us (*about this well-known effort*).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What was funny was, this started a chain reaction, with one of his San Antonio donors, who happens also to be the governor&#039;s appointee as chairman of TxDOT, deciding that a similar planning effort to refurbish a street in San Antonio - a city that has heretofore not been in the governor&#039;s sights - must also be jettisoned, because in the murky past this particular road connected to a state highway ...&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What was different was that, this time, the excuse \&quot;you forgot to get permission\&quot; didn&#039;t hold water, because the half decade-long planning effort had been a joint exercise of SA and TxDOT! -  indeed funded by the latter. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All because we&#039;re not getting the best, in our supposed liberty-loving politicians. Their little minds look out at the vast apparatus of government at all levels - and only see red at \&quot;pedestrian-oriented enhancements\&quot;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397339,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Calvin Hobbes&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:21,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:22,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:23,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 10:24:41&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;To get money out of politics, you have to get politics out of money.\&quot; &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On the topic of politics and money, let\u2019s examine the nomination of Lisa Cook to the Fed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The highlight of Cook\u2019s \u201cresearch\u201d is a 2014 paper on the history of black patents. Steve Sailer had a careful look at this paper and wrote up what he found:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Half-Cooked Data&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;https:\/\/www.takimag.com\/article\/half-cooked-data\/&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cook\u2019s paper is spectacularly bad. There can\u2019t be many papers in the entire Economics literature as bad as this one.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;See Figure 1 (from Cook\u2019s paper) at the link.  It shows a cataclysmic drop (by a factor of about 4) in the yearly number of black patents between 1899 and 1900. The 1899 number is similar to the numbers for earlier in the decade, and the 1900 number is similar to the numbers up through 1940.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just from looking at this graph, a sensible person not completely ignorant of American history would be almost certain that this cataclysmic drop in Cook\u2019s graph is not real.  If anything had happened in 1899 that might cause such a sudden drop, you\u2019d know about it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The actual explanation for the drop in Cook\u2019s graph is that she got most of her data on black patents from an effort in 1900 to find examples of black patents. There was a similar effort in 1913, but Cook ignored the data from that, leading to the drop in her graph.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Other people have subsequently looked at black patent numbers, and (surprise!) they don\u2019t see Cook\u2019s drop.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cook\u2019s graph also obscures to an amazing degree just how minuscule the number of black patents was, relative to the total number of patents. That\u2019s done by using different vertical scales for black patent numbers and total patent numbers. Sailer has a graph with a common scale, on which the black patent rate hardly budges from zero.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Cook then attributed the (implausible and in fact nonexistent) sudden drop in her graph to lynchings and anti-black riots. A large fraction of black patents were coming from blacks in the North, where there weren\u2019t many lynchings or anti-black riots, but she argued that lynchings and riots in the South caused blacks in the North to suddenly stop filing patents between 1899 and 1900.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It should be a scandal for Economics that Lisa Cook is a full professor of Economics at Michigan State, and that her nomination to the Fed is supported by big shots like Romer and Krugman, with Harald Uhlig being a lonely voice from Econ in opposition.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Uhlig did not object to Cook because Cook is stupid and incompetent. Uhlig objected because when Uhlig ridiculed the obvious stupidity of Defund The Police (which is something Cook supported), Cook\u2019s response was STFU YOU F\u2019ING RACIST and to get Uhlig fired from a consulting gig at the Fed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397362,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Phinton&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:21,&quot;downboops&quot;:20,&quot;vote_count&quot;:41,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 11:27:16&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;What is really unreal here is how readily Paul Romer was suckered by the data.

That is, he knows the data and methodology are likely suspect, but that&#039;s OK, in his mind he&#039;s no longer dealing with the A-team, and gushing over the conclusions from the C-team is warranted. Soft bigotry of low expectations again.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And this, kids, is how poor research infects the academy. think how often our \&quot;bedrock\&quot; knowledge is formed by bad research (eg men beat women more during the superbowl, women earn just 80% of men and on an on). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That which we think we know is usually wrong.

I think one thing those who champion the public choice theory overlook is history. Before the reforms adopted in the 1930s, firms and their owners had no check on what they elected to do, no unions, no regulators, and they could be harsh in their treatment of individuals who tried to challenge them. The regulatory state was adopted in that context, the regulators to help bring order and stability to the chaos, with large unions providing a balance of power for large employers. That was the environment coming out of WWII, the period after WWII marked by shared prosperity. Sure, there were conflicts between labor and management, but mostly order and stability. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, we know what happened, a shift in the public mood due in large part to the Vietnam War and domestic racial unrest, and a succession of law and order administrations that vilified unions and sought to conflate  the regulatory state and the civil rights movement. Rather than fight the regulatory state, Nixon enlarged it, while appointing administrators that were mostly hostile to labor and opposed to the regulatory state. Reagan was even bolder, appointing administrators whose job was to dismantle the agencies they administered, while at the same time promoting an agenda (including large deficits) that helped shift industry to Asia, weakening labor to the point that there is no balance of power between labor and management, management, with the help from courts packed with judges who are hostile to both labor and the regulatory state. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The public choice theory puts a nice gloss on this history, the gloss making the history opaque. The real issue is whose interest does the regulatory state promote: the public interest or private interests? Of course, the public choice theory includes the premise that there is no public interest, only private interests (including the private interests of those who work in the regulatory state). In other words, there is no issue to discuss because there is no such thing as the public interest.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397425,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Y Contributor&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 13:07:46&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;As a Silicon Valley laborer for many years, my family and I are financially grateful to have avoided a union&#039;s hostile machinations between management and myself.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397540,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;rayward&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 18:07:06&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for emphasizing the point: the public interest vs. self-interest.

In this situation, the small community would be best served by combining services with other small, neighboring communities. By best served, I mean most bang for their buck.

An HOA can block development in one neighborhood, a national government the entire country.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Alex&#039;s story is one in which an HOA tried to block construction of his home because the committee didn&#039;t like flat roofs and big windows.  His home sits on 5 acres and can&#039;t even be seen by his neighbors.  He was able to get his neighbors to overrule the HOA committee.  What would have been his chances of overturning a regulation set by some federal agency in Washington, DC?  His story is not one demonstrating the benefits of national government over HOAs.  It&#039;s a story about how government at *any* level shouldn&#039;t have had a particular power.  Given that his property wasn&#039;t even visible to neighbors, the aesthetics of his house should not have been a collective decision.  Alex literally says that.  One might disagree with his point, but one shouldn&#039;t misrepresent the point of his story.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An anti-government argument, when the government happens to be an HOA, is not an anti-HOA argument in the context of comparing HOAs to state and national governments.  One sees this a lot, especially when it comes to public choice.  Public choice points out a problem with government generally and, because the government in question happens to be democratically elected, people (even some public choice proponents) say that public choice is anti-democracy.  No, anti-democracy is when one favors non-democratic government like monarchy over democracy.  Nothing in public choice suggests that monarchs or dictators suffer less from the same non-benevolence and non-omniscience that democratically elected governments suffer from.  Public choice merely starts with an observation that democracy in and of itself does not lead to benevolent and omniscient government.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397328,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:11,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:11,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:11,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 09:58:13&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Alex\u2019s point of how regulation costs stack is never more real than when building houses.
