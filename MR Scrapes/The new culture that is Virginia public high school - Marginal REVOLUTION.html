He was recently named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the last decade and several years ago Bloomberg BusinessWeek dubbed him \"America's Hottest Economist.\" Foreign Policy magazine named him as one of its \"Top 100 Global Thinkers\" of 2011. His next book, about American business, is due out in 2019. He has blogged at Marginal Revolution every day for almost fifteen years.","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/tylercowen"],"url":"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/author/tyler-cowen"}]}</script>

    <blockquote><p>“I see these people just not wearing a mask, or wearing one pulled down, like, under their chin,” said Swan, “and my brain just immediately goes, ‘That person does not share the same ideals as me. We won’t get along.’ ” She added: “They may not be a bad person. They may just be thinking the same things as their parents.”</p>
<p>&#8230;School now feels, Swan said, “like a war zone”: a raging partisan battle that no one can opt out of, because every single student arrives with evidence of their politics — those without masks typically lean right, she said — written across their faces. Swan said she has stopped speaking with students who go maskless because they are dismissive of the decision to mask and unwilling to hear a different opinion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/02/18/virginia-masking-student-voices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the full story</a>, which is interesting throughout.  Perhaps the French solution would be to ban masks!  In the meantime, how about a policy of mandated no-masks for the teachers and administrators, unless they have health exemptions, and mask choice for each student? Or how else might we limit social strife over masking decisions? How can we move closer to the no-school masking equilibria of much of Europe&gt;</p>
<p>As a side note, I believe masks have some effectiveness, but not total effectiveness, and so it is striking to me how much those in real danger think the masked environment is somehow acceptable.  Some amount of risk is totally, absolutely fine, as they are not home schooling (which still would involve risk, I might add).  But risk beyond that level is somehow a complete no-no &#8212; is it that they all have so accurately done the cost-benefit calculations using expected utility theory?  Keep in mind that along a great number of the equilibrium paths, masks delay but do not prevent infection.</p>

Given his condition, he should not be in school during any period where RSVs have a significant chance of circulating.  This includes any typical flu season.   No precautions short of enclosing every child  and adult in a mobile plexiglass bubble (with exhaust tubes going directly to the ventilation system to be expelled into the air), will balance his risk\/reward appropriately.  Cloth or surgical masks, even if worn properly, can&#039;t come close to achieving this goal.   &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;While mRNA vaccination is a good thing for many of the kids and certainly Caleb, the data shows that forcing those on everyone in the school won&#039;t be enough to reduce his risks of getting infected enough given the likely outcome of such for him.   The flu vaccines too (especially) - they&#039;re just not good enough.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is therefore pointless to impose these costs on the rest of the kids.  It won&#039;t help Caleb enough to make it sensible for him to be there.  He should stay home.   Since his parents have already paid (possibly against their will) for his education, the schools\/government\/tax-payers should accommodate by providing him with substitute instruction that does not impose any health risks.  Better yet, they should refund all of his parents&#039; tax dollars so they can self-interestedly shop for the best available substitute education.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397983,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;steve&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 15:26:50&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Not true. People who are boosted are much less likely to have serious illness than those who are not boosted. They are also a bit less likely to get  infected. But this is just for Omicron. Since they came out the vaccines have been pretty effective against infection.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Are you talking about the people who are insisting on vaccinating children and babies even though the actual benefit of doing so is negligible?\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The absolute risk is small. The relative risk advantage of the vaccine is high for kids. Do you oppose vaccinating kids if their caregivers are at high risk?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397981,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Bob from Ohio&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 15:24:37&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Swan said she has stopped speaking with students who go maskless because they are dismissive of the decision to mask and unwilling to hear a different opinion\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like she is also \&quot;dismissive of the decision\&quot; and \&quot;unwilling to hear a different opinion\&quot;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Her arms must be sore from her constant back patting herself on  her virtue.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398070,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Marc T&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 17:32:31&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;It\u2019s actually the constant face palming and handwringing that did it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398070]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397910,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;peri&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 12:53:42&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;For some reason all this puts me in mind of an (actual - yes; earnest?) question asked on an Amazon product listing I was studying, for a \&quot;bunion corrector\&quot; - a velcroed piece of fabric you slip over your foot. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Will I be able to stop wearing the bunion corrector once my bunion is corrected, or will I have to wear it the rest of my life?\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397862,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Bob&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:4,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 11:32:31&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Almost none of you are following the real train of thought here. Ms. Swan doesn&#039;t care about masks because she thinks they serve any real medical purpose. She doesn&#039;t even really talk about that angle and, consciously or unconsciously, she knows masks aren&#039;t about the pandemic anymore.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Masks are a fashion accessory that also indicates your social group. Masks are to liberals what a cross or a crucifix might be to a Christian. It&#039;s a way of visually identifying who is a part of your tribe and whom you might be interested in interacting with socially or romantically.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just as Christians have always used the cross as a way to identify who is socially acceptable to them and their families, liberals now have a mask.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just ask yourselves if you would be frothing at the mouth like this if you replaced every instance of \&quot;mask\&quot; in that article with \&quot;cross\&quot; or \&quot;star of David.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397873,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;peri&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 12:03:44&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Raised American Protestant.

There was very little intersectional dating between groups and not much intersectional socializing, when it wasn&#039;t enforced by the school, particularly among with those involved in casual athletics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Those little charms are a hell of an in-group\/out-group marker, and masks are just another example that people are using to tell whom they should share their scarce attention with and whom they shouldn&#039;t.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397931,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;peri&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 13:14:13&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;That is very old indeed.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397931]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397924,160397931]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397873,160397924,160397931]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397861,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Steve&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 11:31:01&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThey may not be a bad person.

I just have the feeling that if it wasn&#039;t this it would have been something else. We&#039;ve already had cases of brand names becoming highly politicised, it was only a matter of time before one of the things that became politicised was something that wasn&#039;t optional. Taking the knee was already having this effect in many contexts: if you decide to have a moment to offer people the chance to take the knee at an event, you immediately force everyone into a taking a side. It&#039;s not accidental, it&#039;s done to root out the moderates.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397845,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Paul Kramer&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 10:59:59&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Risk is a very misunderstood concept.

So masks probably saved thousands of lives if you were wearing them at the start of the pandemic and delayed getting sick. The mortality rate for inpatients at the start was well over twice what it is now. Large benefit. If you were wearing a mask 6 months later less benefit as we were better at treating covid but still meaningful. Now that we have vaccines and pretty soon enough paxlovid to be meaningful the return is pretty small. I think we should keep wearing them in hospitals (which means we have to put up with the death threats and violence from the anti-maskers) but otherwise I think it should be a local decision. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What we see in our area is that the anti-masker people are pretty aggressive. In the schools the non-mask wearing kids are pretty aggressive about harassing those who do. Some of those kids are being raised by grandparents  or have siblings who have health issues and want to do what they can to keep them safe. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is interesting that people who claim to dislike mandates on liberty principles seem to be OK with mandates AGAINST wearing masks. Anyway, if I asked I would let teachers decide if they want to wear masks and same for students.

However, it\u2019s definitely not immune from the public health irrationality bug.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In this case, the first thing to note is that Tyler chose the least sympathetic of the pro-mask perspectives in the article: the girl concerned about Pawpaw, or the boy with serious lung issues, have more compelling stories.  Next, the idea that teachers should be subjected to a no-mask requirement, when they\u2019re already facing labor market discrimination by not being able to take long term advantage of work from home, or hybrid home\/office arrangements, is problematic.  Is it really the state\u2019s place to tell its employees that they can\u2019t take a basic public health precaution, particularly when the value of that precaution has been affirmed by countless experts?  The issue isn\u2019t what Tyler thinks about masks; rather, it\u2019s whether a person\u2019s view of masks falls within a range of reasonable opinion.  And for both teachers and students, a reasonable person could continue to favor mask-wearing.  Furthermore, by imposing a mandatory no-mask rule for teachers, while giving students a choice, the state would be sending three negative signals. First, it would be advertising that it isn\u2019t very bright: logically, the higher risk population (teachers), should have more flexibility than the lower risk group (students).  Second, it would single out mask-wearing students as abnormal because there wouldn\u2019t be adult role models to validate their choices (although I\u2019m not sure whether kids take cues from adults as much as they did when I grew up).  Third, and perhaps most importantly, it would be suggesting that the state should have the right to manage individual freedom in the same way that people handle their thermostats: turning it up in some rooms, and down in others, depending on personal preferences.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for the broader question about dealing with arguments over masks in schools, or whether the mandates should continue, I don\u2019t have an opinion.  Sadly, the pandemic is still alive and kicking, and unless Tyler is arguing that getting Covid is a good thing, then postponing it still makes sense (better vaccines, treatments, and, perhaps, making the burden on hospitals more manageable by spacing out cases).  On the other hand, social interaction is a vital part of school, and I think a reasonable student could have a strong preference against wearing masks, particularly if they\u2019re fully vaccinated.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Overall, I\u2019m not sure if school mask mandates are still a good idea, but I\u2019m positive that mask prohibition is a stinker.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398252,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Russell&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-21 05:20:06&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Aren\u2019t mask prohibition and mandate prohibition different things?

I&#039;m sure there are still schools here in England that still encourage mask wearing, but my sense is that it is not like in the US. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Masking wearing in shops in England is no longer mandatory.

Most masks here are simple cloth masks. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The amount of anxiety\/concern some people (especially healthy young people) continue to feel about people who don&#039;t wear masks seems over the top.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397872,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Todd K&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 12:00:59&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Osterholm has flipped twice on the effectiveness of masks.

In a June podcast Osterholm said he wears a mask in public because people expect him to. After getting a lot of angry emails from the left he did a 180 and barked on his podcast a couple of weeks later: \&quot;WEAR A MASK!\&quot; which he repeated for a year.

The Supreme Court has made clear that students while at school do not have the same constitutional rights as when away from school, such as 4th amendment rights; indeed, schools may even impose restrictions on students outside the school boundaries. And students will push the boundaries of acceptable behavior. In my day the battle was over such things as the acceptable length of a boy&#039;s hair or a girl&#039;s skirt, students willing to risk suspension over the freedom to wear long hair or short skirts. Hence, it&#039;s not at all surprising that schools today have become a battleground over mask-mandates and similar pandemic restrictions. Meanwhile, I would not be surprised if the Supreme Court rules against the enforceability of school mask mandates, resulting in the ironic situation that students have the freedom to choose not to wear a mask during a pandemic but don&#039;t have the 4th amendment freedom against what otherwise would be an unlawful search and seizure. https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rynxqdNMry4&amp;amp;ab_channel=SebastianWalter&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397732,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Russell&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:4,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:4,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:4,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 05:27:27&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty good paper and worth reading in full.&lt;br \/&gt;\nhttps:\/\/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/1055639\/Evidence_summary_-_face_coverings.pdf&lt;br \/&gt;\nIt supports masks but says the evidence is very weak.

I believe this because this assumption is explicitly baked into masking guidelines and the expectations\/behaviors of rulemakers. I am not allowed to remove my mask, except in the gym, at a restaurant, or on a _cramped airplane surrounded by strangers to eat a bag of peanuts._ If the gain from masking is so small that I and hundreds of stangers can all relax the rule at the same time for a soda and crackers, in an airplane on a direct flight, or the governor can relax it at the Super Bowl, why should I believe masks would keep people who see each other every day at work or school from getting the disease eventually? If vaccines work 100%, or you think current ones don&#039;t but the next one will, your time and effort should go to that rather than masks. Every unmasked person you waste time thinking about is a jab that you didn&#039;t schedule for someone over the phone, for instance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;WaPo conveys the high transitory costs of a law \&quot;...ensuring every one of Virginia\u2019s more than 1.8 million public and private schoolchildren will face masking decisions and tensions at school in days to come...As the adults battle over the merits of masking, Virginia students have been forced to navigate the real-life fallout.\&quot; &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1) The political cases are the least compelling. At a moderate level are the kids who just hate masks and whose glasses fog up. Most compelling, of course, are the girl whose grandparent has multiple ailments, and the student who has lung problems. The grandparent case would seem to be best solved by solved by testing, no?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2) Ultimately, the story should hinge on targeted action for the benefit of Caleb, the young man most endangered by COVID. What is shocking about this story, and COVID policy in general, is how wildly (and evenly) it distributes costs and benefits. Kids are the group least likely to be hospitalized by a lot and still under the most restrictive rules outside of the elderly in nursing homes. If you know a single kid is at serious risk of COVID, you throw the kitchen sink at his problems, make all accomodations, Zoom classes, plexiglass for him, etc. The WaPo comment section is arguing that \&quot;optional\&quot; is a terrible policy, but leave the mask mandate in place there is still a high chance that there&#039;s an outbreak at schools, like Omicron this January. Inventing your way out of this problem for the most vulnerable is far more practical AND ethically respectable than, say, adults effectively leaving the choice in the hands of pre-teens.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3) People seem to be running a mix of optimized hedonism and CYA when it makes the least sense. A friend of mine had one covid test. He got covid tested before going to a summer concert, effectively wasting the test since he didn&#039;t know if the other people were testing. Your prior would be that you don&#039;t have covid - no symptoms, summer, etc. You would want to test *afterwards* if you were going to the concert. If you go to a concert and use your one test beforehand, you are more worried about *you* spreading covid than the spread of covid, right? Is this really liberal concern for your fellow man? On the other hand, if a seven year old takes of his mask to pick his nose, sneezes, and unleashes an outbreak upon his class, do we hold this kid responsible for deaths, or the people who put him in that situation? Does it make a difference if the kid sneezes during lunchtime, when masks are off for everyone?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;4) The newspaper providing the names of these kids is deranged. If it&#039;s as bad as you say, a political \&quot;war zone\&quot;, each of those kids deserves an alias to protect them from retribution by teachers who consume too much political news ...like, idk, WaPo.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397706,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Harvey Bungus&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 04:03:41&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;5) Law Changes, Those Affected in Disarray could be a new Markets in Everything&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397706]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397694,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;MikeP&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:31,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:33,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:35,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 03:32:06&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As a side note, I believe masks have some effectiveness, but not total effectiveness, and so it is striking to me how much those in real danger think the masked environment is somehow acceptable.&lt;\/em&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Not total\&quot; does not mean 96% or 97%, which is how effective masks would need to be to be definitively helpful in a 6 hour school day or an 8 hour work day. \&quot;Not total\&quot; is realistically between 0% and 20% effective, changing a \&quot;contract\&quot; from 15 minutes to 20.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So, yes, it is a real question how many people have died because they or someone else believed masks were effective.

If you take it off every 30 mins to sip water, every four hours to eat, and every time you feel like scratching your nose or sneezing or just so your voice can be heard, they probably don\u2019t work. The seal also loosens if you are wearing the same mask every day to the point where after a couple days, I bet they are no better than cloth masks.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160397734,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;RAD&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:6,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:8,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:10,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 05:32:50&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Omicron&#039;s fitness advantage over Delta is mostly due to antibody escape in the community rather than an innate property of the virus that increases aerosol transmission.

Europe is pretty heterogeneous in this matter and it is all gated on age. Highschool masking more common than not, elementary school less common than not, pre-school\/daycare age fairly uncommon. https:\/\/www.thejournal.ie\/face-mask-requirements-school-children-europe-ireland-5617916-Dec2021\/ lists a bunch someone should make a good chart of this.  Buy age cutoff varies by country &amp;gt;12,9,6 are common points.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In what remains to me the most baffling aspect of the whole thing, my toddlers daycare re-opened in Aug. of 2020 and did not require masking in children under 6 (per guidelines at the time and what I believe is still WHO recommended policy). It&#039;s a company facility in CA that is for an employer with a large essential worker contingent hence the earlier opening.  In March of 2021, after vaccines were out and all the staff were vaccinated and after the 2020-2021 winter wave was winding down, they introduced a masking mandate for 2-6 year olds that remains in place to this day.  I just don&#039;t don&#039;t get what logical cost benefit analysis could possible lead to that order of events.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Anyways, switched daycares a couple of months ago to one that pays more lip service to the mandates (they have to wear the masks going in and coming out, but with the classroom they don&#039;t try that hard to force the two year olds to wear the masks).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Official policy in a lot of places in CA is that the unvaccinated must wear masks or be &amp;lt; 2. Given that only 2-5 year olds are prohibited from vaccinating currently that effectively means that is the only age that this is feasible enforce on.  You get the craziness that is nobody wearing masks except 2-5 year old, literally the least at risk population group even sans vaccine.  That said enforcement is rapidly waning, I think people feel ridiculous telling a 3 year old to wear a mask when no one else is.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397841]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397659,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Aristophanes&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:72,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:73,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:74,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 02:02:17&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;What a surprise that ~80% of the pro-maskers interviewed in the article seem fundamentally horrified and unable to cope with the idea that some other kid might hold a different opinion.

There is decent evidence that if boosted you are less likely to spread covid. Less so with Omicron but it has help all along during the 14 months we have had people refusing to get vaccinated. So yes the unvaccinated are the big risk. A small risk to others in terms of spreading the disease. They are a huge risk to the hospital systems. They keep insisting upon going to the hospital when they get sick and they do it in surges. Makes it hard to provide care to others with non covid illnesses. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Not sure how to measure it but I would bet that we got more people vaccinated due to the mandates as you note.

The Covid data tracker has child deaths of 1346 over the entire course of the pandemic (so since February 2020). The provisional counts (https:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/nchs\/nvss\/vsrr\/covid_weekly\/index.htm) put child Covid deaths at 822 over the entire pandemic. So we have somewhere between 800 and 1400 child deaths over 2 years. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To put that in perspective, the CDC estimates that ~430 children die each year flu (average over the last decade). It is estimated that ~1200 children died from flu in the 2012-13 season. And this is with 65% of kids getting vaccinated for seasonal flu. Are you equally frantic and want to inhibit a normal childhood during flu season? If so, good for your consistency, but I doubt you care enough about the effect seasonal flu has on child mortality to splatter comments on the internet about it. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On long Covid, Stat has a good roundup of the research entitled \&quot;Controlled studies ease worries of widespread long Covid in kids\&quot;. (not including links so it doesn&#039;t get caught in the spam filter)&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is also estimated that ~500 children die and 80,000 hospitalized each year from RSV. Are you beating the \&quot;We need to bubble wrap children because of RSV\&quot; drum? I think not, but if so, again, congrats on your consistency.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that post-viral syndrome also occurs from flu as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Can you tell us why you are so concerned about Covid and not about flu or RSV or accidental drowning or a myriad of other things that cause death and hospitalization and long term illness in children?

I certainly won&#039;t.  I encourage others not to.  These two years of masking were certainly one of the gravest immoralities I&#039;ve ever witnessed, but it didn&#039;t come out of nowhere.  It is a manifestation of an entire elite progressive impulse that is eating away at every single institutions, especially the schools.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That impulse has not been solved.  It&#039;s just backing off on this one particular thing before the mid terms.  It&#039;s a pragmatic tactical retreat and nothing more.  All the ugliness that lead to it is still in place.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The fundamental issue here is that the mask side hasn&#039;t learned its lesson.  It doesn&#039;t understand why it was wrong.  It hasn&#039;t learned any humility about wielding power.  They are as arrogant, emotional, and incapable of empathy, rationality, and cost\/benefit analysis as ever.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The same traits that led them to mandate masks lead them to mandate all sorts of things.  The same sloppy logic and puritanical mode that causes my school board to advocate masking also causes it to advocate Critical Race Theory, or Transgender Ideology, or covered up rapes, or designating parents domestic terrorists.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m not going to send my kids to a school run by these psychopathic child abusers simply because under immense public pressure they have, after two years, relented on this one issue, for now, when their hand was completely forced and not a minute before.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Even Tyler doesn&#039;t have the courage to admit that he&#039;s been on the wrong side of this issue for two years because he&#039;s a coward.

That girl had more courage then you Tyler.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Just admit you never should have supported masks.  Have a backbone for once.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like everyone else I&#039;ve always had political opinions, but I never really thought that politics would matter that much to my day to day life.  Then they tried to cover our faces all day and it was obvious that we can&#039;t actually live together because they won&#039;t let us live.
