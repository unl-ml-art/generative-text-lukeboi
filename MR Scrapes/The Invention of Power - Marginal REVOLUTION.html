He was recently named in an Economist poll as one of the most influential economists of the last decade and several years ago Bloomberg BusinessWeek dubbed him \"America's Hottest Economist.\" Foreign Policy magazine named him as one of its \"Top 100 Global Thinkers\" of 2011. His next book, about American business, is due out in 2019. He has blogged at Marginal Revolution every day for almost fifteen years.","sameAs":["https://twitter.com/tylercowen"],"url":"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/author/tyler-cowen"}]}</script>

    <p>The author is Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, and the subtitle is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invention-Power-Popes-Kings-Birth/dp/B09MZPTPM8/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3P4632ME8R9OV&amp;keywords=the+invention+of+power&amp;qid=1645148819&amp;sprefix=the+invention+of+p%2Caps%2C328&amp;sr=8-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Popes, Kings, and the Birth of the West</a>.Â  Here is the main thesis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why Europe became distinct after the year 1000 and not before can be reduced to this surprisingly simple reason: in Europe, the head of religion and the head(s) of state were different people who faced off against one another in long-standing, long-lasting, intense competition for political control.Â  Certainly, the rulers of China and Japan were thought to be gods.</p></blockquote>
<p>I consider this broadly consistent with my own views, although I see many other significant factors in the broader history, including natural geography and political fragmentation.Â  Nor can you dismiss the role of imperialism entirely, plus that the growth of the West came &#8220;at the right time&#8221; (for the West at least).Â  I like this book, but I don&#8217;t think it quite has the knockdown proof of its thesis that it pretends to.Â  And the book is oddly silent about Christianity <em>as a general phenomenon</em>.Â  There is talk of popes and churches on almost every page, and yet <em>Christianity as an intellectual innovation</em>, helping to make liberalism more likely, does not play much of a role in the narrative.Â  And given how general and deeply rooted some of the mechanisms are, I don&#8217;t quite understand why so much stress is placed on the 1122 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_Controversy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concordat of Worms</a> &#8212; surely that is endogenous too?Â  It is an odd philosophy of history in which so much hinges on a single event and then for almost a thousand years the rest that follows is locked in.</p>

Having a separate head of religion and head of state is heavily a result of the natural geography of Europe making it hard to have a continent wide empire vs. China.  The Holy Roman Empire wished it could have been Europe, including Rome, but it failed miserably.  In contrast, not only did the Chinese tend to have very large contiguous states even when broken into warring kingdoms, but the entire imperial examination system and the fact that the elites shared a common written language.  This point is not well understood.  A written language that was the same, regardless of which Chinese dialect was being spoken, that was hard to learn and mostly impervious to the peasantry meant for much lower administrative costs for the state with barriers to entry from the hoi polloi.  In contrast, Latin was never totally dominant and often shared official writing with some local language. In China, having a local written system of laws based on the provincial language was literally impossible for well over a thousand years.  So weak states led to weak organized church power as well.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396930,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Stephen Lindsay&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 13:01:08&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; And the book is oddly silent about Christianity as a general phenomenon.  There is talk of popes and churches on almost every page, and yet Christianity as an intellectual innovation, helping to make liberalism more likely, does not play much of a role in the narrative.&amp;lt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, everyone these days is doing mental gymnastics to avoid tracing anything back to Jesus Christ, whose teachings induced a revolutionary upheaval in philosophy, morality, psychology, social structures, and legal theory, (not to mention religion). \u201cInventing the Individual\u201d by Larry Siedentop is a good exception.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396900,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Albigensian&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 12:34:02&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\u201cEurope, the head of religion and the head(s) of state were different people who faced off against one another in long-standing, long-lasting, intense competition for political control.\u201d One might, perhaps, at least question the extent to which Christian scripture\u2019s admonition to \u201crender unto Caesar\u201d influenced the evolution of Church and State in European history, and especially in the high and late medieval periods. It seems a distinguishing characteristic; thus, one sees nothing remotely similar to \u201crender unto Caesar\u201d in Islam, for example.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But by the late medieval and early modern period merchants and merchant-run cities became yet another center of power, along with Princes and Popes. This multiplicity of power-centers in Europe mostly did not exist elsewhere, and thus might have played a role in Europe\u2019s rise to global dominance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, given that proof here is impossible, I can\u2019t help seeing many of these explanations as \u201cjust-so\u201d stories: entertaining, perhaps, but not legitimate scholarship.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396805,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sean Kelleher&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 11:21:44&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\u201c It is an odd philosophy of history in which so much hinges on a single event and then for almost a thousand years the rest that follows is locked in.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That\u2019s the best sentence I\u2019ve ever read on MR.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396737,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Blades&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:5,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:5,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 10:12:42&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;In support of Tyler\u2019s position that Christianity made liberalism more likely: it had an underlying philosophy of the importance of even the lowliest individual.  All men are created equal, if you will.  Basic point but so far unsaid, I think.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396733,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Norman&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 09:59:06&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Judging from the blurb, the argument seems to be very similar to that made by Jared Rubin, in Rulers, Religion, and Riches: Why the West Got Rich and the Middle East Did Not&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396706,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Dino the Isaurian&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:27:36&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Probably the most pivotal event in the separation of church and state in western civilization was Ambrose forcing the repentance of Theodosius. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And most people today are unaware of the event or it\u2019s significance.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396702,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;John Denver&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:14:39&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s still hard for me to follow, but I find Marshall Mcluhan&#039;s thesis fascinating. As I understand it, he attributes the rise of the west to the phonetic alphabet, which gave rise to abstract thought as we now understand it. This created a \&quot;visual culture\&quot;, once the printing press allowed phonetic literacy to spread far and wide. This roughly correlates with the timeline in question.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Worth checking out if interested: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=b9fKhsZuKO4&amp;amp;t=1586&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396685,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;rayward&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 06:49:59&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Speaking of government, Ezra Klein interviews Alex Tabarrok about the public choice theory of government failure: https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2022\/02\/18\/opinion\/ezra-klein-podcast-alex-tabarrok.html&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396684,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;rayward&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:4,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 06:34:18&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Certainly, the rulers of China and Japan were thought to be gods.\&quot; And so were the rulers of Rome. Unlike other major religions, Christians have an obligation to spread the religion, and spread it they did. One benefit of spreading the religion is that people in different places (different languages, cultures, etc.) had something important in common, a shared religion, the commonality creating the trust necessary for trade, which produced the relatively high rate of economic growth.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396700,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;mm&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:11:02&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Roman emperor as God ended with the ascent of Constantine &amp;amp; definitively with Theodesius&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396700]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396683,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Zaua&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:4,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 06:26:31&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\u201cThe West\u201d didn\u2019t really diverge from the rest of the world until the 19th century (at which point divergence is explained mainly by industrialization spreading through trading links), mostly England did, and then to some extent neighbors of England like France and Holland (though Holland stagnated in the 1700s after losing the Anglo-Dutch Wars). Most of \u201cthe West\u201d like Italy, Germany, Austria-Hungary, etc. were not more advanced than China or Japan in the 1700s. Thus, any theory of divergence that applies to \u201cthe West\u201d broadly is too broad. We ought to be looking specifically for factors or combinations of factors that existed in England but not other countries.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396892,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;M&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 12:29:39&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Not really.

I don&#039;t think you can point to any individual thing that it all rested upon. Technology, culture, genetics, institutions, military victories, etc were all part of it. Around 1000 AD Europe was probably slightly behind or about as advanced as China or the Islamic world. Nothing really special. By 1500 they were more advanced, wealthy, and powerful. Enough so that little Portugese could circumnavigate Africa, make their way to India, and with just a few hundred men take on entire navies and win(Battle of Cochin 1504). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I would posit that the high middle ages, fueled by the medieval agricultural revolution, helped lead to a more prosperous and powerful Europe. The invention and or adoption of the heavy plow, horse collar, horse shoe, whippletree, and three crop rotation systems all combined by the year 1000 AD to produce a kind of peasant plenty that allowed a lot more population growth and the rebirth of big towns and small cities. Economists have argued that European cities of the late medieval period were \&quot;producer cities\&quot; meaning they generated products that flowed out as opposed to cities in the MENA that tended to consume a lot of what the surrounding hinterlands made. Those producers cities in Italy helped create the Renaissance. Another major advantage over the MENA was the use of professional soldiers and not Mamluks(enslaved soldiers). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In terms of technology by 1500 Europeans had invented or adopted fully mechanical clocks, printing presses, universities, muskets, caravels, windmills, magnetic compasses, astrolabes, blast furnaces, double entry book keeping, glasses, and heavy plows. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Regarding the military situation by 1500 Byzantium was gone and the Ottoman Empire was very powerful and dominated the SE quadrant of Europe. But, the Iberians had fully liberated themselves from Islamic rule and the Golden Horde was on the verge of collapse in Russia. The 100 Years War was over for England and France. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Medieval Europe was very violent, but for something like 800 years about 1-2% of the male population in Western Europe was executed for violent crimes. Violent crime rates plummeted in the late medieval period. That use of execution has to have had some selective pressure on the population&#039;s genes. The Black Plague killed anywhere from 75-150 million people in a few years. Throw in the long standing ban on cousin-marriage by the Church and I&#039;m guessing you&#039;ve got a recipe for much \&quot;fitter\&quot; people. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Medieval Europe was also very commercial and reasonably well off. Incentives matter and the profit motive there was much stronger than in China or India where for regulatory and cultural reason you really didn&#039;t try to get ahead too much. Whereas Europeans, especially after the fall of Constantinople, were eager to fund merchent voyages around Africa or across the globe. In terms of income, some rough estimates suggest that during the 1000-1500 year period most parts of Europe were richer in terms of per capita income and wages than China, India, or Japan. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Tyler mentions fragmentation. That was true for the German speakers of the Holy Roman Empire and probably had some advantages. But. also had disadvantages. Like every princeling wanting to tax your boat as it went down the Rhine. There was also centralization. England&#039;s transition from a heptarchy into a monarchy. The unification of Spain and the formation of France. Ultimately these places built empires where the Germans and Italians wouldn&#039;t unify until the 19th century. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Medieval Agricultural Revolution(600-1000 AD)\u2192High Middle Ages(1000-1300 AD)\u2192Renaissance(1400-1600)\u2192Age of Exploration(15th century onward)\u2192Scientific Revolution(17th century)\u2192Enlightenment(~18th century)\u2192First Industrial Revolution(1750-1820) &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1300-1400 was a crisis period that saw major wars, the Little Ice Age, Great Famine of 1315, and Black Death of 1346-1353. It was a big step backward.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396730,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;M&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 09:43:56&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Luka: &lt;i&gt;\&quot;That use of execution has to have had some selective pressure on the population&#039;s genes.\&quot;&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s possible but it depends on how it happens. If you kill one brigand and then you open up a niche for the son of another brigand, then it doesn&#039;t really help.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or if you introduce a cultural change that encourages violent people to avoid killing each other, to avoid trouble with the law, you may make an aspect of the underlying genetic phenotype more common.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s hard to infer from this alone what the overall selective pressure is, and we&#039;ll probably never have an incredible understanding of the genetic correlates of very complex outcome like violent crime, nor enough genetic data to understand change in frequency.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt; Incentives matter and the profit motive there was much stronger than in China or India where for regulatory and cultural reason you really didn&#039;t try to get ahead too much. &lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of Indian Ocean and Chinese sea trade going on. The Chinese and Indians didn&#039;t really have incentives to get around the middle to trade with the West.

A free-for all scrum that birthed innovation in numerous fields, but especially militarily.   The components of that  diversity (or fragmentation) were large enough to prevent anyone group from becoming predominant.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396701,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sure&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:25,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:25,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:25,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:11:07&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Some indicators of divergence were already present by 1000 AD. Firstly. per capita animal power was much higher in Western Europe than the rest of the world. Africa had sleeping sickness, the New World had extremely few domesticated animals, while the population centers of the Middle East, India, Southeast Asia, China, and Japan had such high populations that their agriculture used far more human labor.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, European crop yields are quite striking for limited irrigation use and, attendantly the limited amount of annual corvee labor. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And on it goes. The mercantile privileges of the average European in 1000 were far stronger than those in China or even the Eastern Roman Empire. Carolingian miniscule was both wildly easier to learn to read and write than anything like traditional Chinese, Japanese, or Arabic and would also be much easier to adopt to moveable type. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And then we come to Christianity. Europe had the lowest percentage of slaves of any society in the world at that point. Only a handful of recently Christianized societies had any significant number of slaves, all of them were seeing declines in their slave populations, and even within that slaves had vastly more rights in Europe than elsewhere (which should not surprise us as many of the colonial slavers explicitly banned converting their slaves lest Africans become just another set of Christians who must needs to be freed). Woman had actual options other than marriage and householding and decidedly less mutilation (e.g. FGM, foot binding) to preserve beauty and marriageability. Women also had far more rights within marriage (i.e. statutory monogamy, extremely limited access to divorce for their husbands, and no general right of husbands to kill their wives). All of these drastically increased the number of people who might contribute to changes in society. It also, already, rewarded higher degrees of paternal investment, and limited the number unemployed, unmarried males available for combat duties. Which in turn gave rise to things like elite shock warfare (far less decimation of the populace\/infrastructure during warfare, extremely strong incentive to adopt expensive force multipliers), high paternal investment in children, expanded literacy, and far more economic mobility for agricultural workers. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And then we have the influence of the church upon the state. Pretty much every empire runs into trouble where Nero or somebody decides to spend the power of the top on personal gratification. Gluttony, lust, and all the vices are not applicable to the ones at the top and the only forces that can stop a licentious emperor are the very forces that splinter the state and bring up crises of legitimacy. By 1000, Christianity provides a moral standard against which even the Holy Roman Emperor could be judged, found wanting, and brought to heel through excommunication and interdict all without bringing apart the polity. And notably the dominant powers that lead the great divergence were all these sorts of long established states that benefited from having no territorial dissolution even when they had their civil wars (e.g. England, France, Portugal, and Castille\/Spain). Likewise, forcing the king to be even slightly circumspect with his mistresses is extremely helpful for limiting the costs of polygamous hypergamy (e.g. it was not uncommon for harem maintenance to cost over 10% of state revenues). Limiting the number of heirs also reduced the likelihood of fratricidal wars and again reinforced the utility of capital accumulation even outside of the ruling elite. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;When looking at a process that spans generations, the slow steady accumulation of incremental gain over generations is vastly more powerful than one off boons. By 1000, Europe had social structures that  provided far more access to technology, education, and limited freedom to the masses than most any other society. Its marriage patterns would reinforce high paternal investment in child rearing, limit the demographic in society most likely to destroy wealth in warfare, and  had already begun showing signs of capital accumulation. The return on social goods like monogamy and independent religious authority compound over time. And it is not shocking, at all, that pretty much every competitor who arose to challenge the Western hegemons only managed to do so once they largely adopted some of these Western social practices. Xi is trying to increase the birthrate, prevent corruption, and generally build out a strong China; but nowhere does he attempt to return to an explicit social morality of ancient China with institutionalized polygamy or the early communist free love ethos. Japan, both post-war and during the Meiji Restoration reinforced cultural norms of institutional monogamy and broad social access to the market and education. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever one thinks about the causes of the Great Divergence, Europe was weird and had been since at least Charlemagne. It is only when focusing on things like economic output that makes Europe look normal, which is exactly the sort of variable that showed no correlation with technological innovation for the preceding three millennia. In terms of long run social forces, particularly those that dominate the world in both Christian and non-Christian societies, Europe is a clear outlier.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396742,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Vulcidian&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:4,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:5,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:6,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 10:15:56&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s surprising to me to read any account of the rise of the West that doesn&#039;t mention \&quot;Greece\&quot; or the \&quot;Greeks\&quot;. Christianity, after all, is just a democratic flavor of Platonism, and the resurgence of temporal authority in the West after 1000 clearly coincides with the rediscovery of Aristotle and his writings on the Greek City States. I guess I still subscribe to the old school belief that the Renaissance was a resumption of progress initiatied by Greek thought after a 700 year detour into eastern mysticism.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396822,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Reason&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 11:36:54&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Hot take, and I like it.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396818,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sure&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:5,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:5,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 11:34:02&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Greek thought was known and well loved by the last Roman pagans; it gave rise to the most autocratic and intrusive states of late antiquity.

The difference is, in Plato\u2019s republic he explicitly acknowledges that this relationship is a lie or convenience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To say Aristotle was obviously useful is to me a tacit admission that you agree with my statement?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397359,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sure&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 11:23:16&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:5,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The most important difference between you and I is that I do not think the Greeks were \&quot;lost\&quot; or \&quot;rediscovered\&quot;. First all of this \&quot;rediscovery\&quot; is basically just a bunch of educated Eastern Roman academics setting up shop in the West. Second, it is not like Greek thought was ever lost in the West. Alcuin managed to learn all of it as Saxon growing up in most barbarous Britain. And lastly the time periods are wildly off. Henry Aristippus, for instance, was translating Phaedo, Meno, Almagest and other works all the way back in the twelfth century. Nor was he alone, the two Gerard of Cremonas were each active in the next centuries. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So what made things different later? In a nutshell, the printing press. Having a few monks read something and diffuse the ideas out to the prelates and on to the nobility was wildly inefficient. Printing it off and sending it directly to fashionable nobles who were literate was far more effective. What made the press possible? The two biggest items were metallurgy and expanded literacy.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Where did these come in? Well European metalworking was heavily driven by the needs of heavily armored knights. Industrial scale production of alloyed armor in Milan and other places lead to a massive diffusion of knowledge that eventually let a peculiar goldsmith tinker until he found a low melting point, sharp setting, and cheap alloy that remained the dominant form of moveable type for centuries. Likewise, the numerous pietistic movements in the West provided a healthy impetus for literacy and a market for not just Bibles, but also saints&#039; biopgraphies, polemaic, and other religious literary works. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The printing press is directly downstream of the more militarized West and her idiosyncratic religious structure. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In any event, I believe we also diverge on the mechanism of divergence. You seem to be holding that the rediscovery of more of the Greek canon lead dramatically to a new ensemble of social, economic, and scientific institutions that then just naturally set the divergence off to the races.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I hold that the divergence, like most exponential functions, was a steady accrual of incremental advantages. As such, I think any for force that compounds century after century is going to handily swamp any one-off gain. The effects of monogamy (i.e. raising TFR per woman, increasing average parental investment in child rearing, limiting annual expenditures on elite hypergamy) will continue to compound century after century.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And like most exponential functions, the first half of the doubling periods will be small, possibly swamped by noise, but nonetheless building a crescendo that would become obvious and undeniable. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Why did it take Christianity 1800 years to show its primacy? Because exponential growth is like that. Compounding at .25% means that for the first millennia we would expect only a tripling of output; but that is far less than the impact of things like the Plague of Justinian. Yet it results in 90-fold growth in the long run. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It seems to me to much a better option than holding out hope for the Greek knowledge, alone, to somehow fail to spark any similar process in spite of near universal knowledge from Bactria to Egypt to Macedonia. With the exception of Greece and Turkey, the places which had the greatest exposure to Hellenistic thought are the least developed and least tolerant to this day. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like I say, I can buy that popular knowledge of Greek ideas resulted in some sort of Christian-Greek fusionism that played a role, but the former is undoubtedly more important than the latter if only because of the dismal outcomes for the Macedonian successor states.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398153,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Vulcidian&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 21:16:24&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:6,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m very curious about your background because you clearly know more about the subject than I do, but I&#039;m still not convinced by your arguments. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The initial post states that Europe began to diverge after the year 1000. The printing press wasn&#039;t invented until the 1430s, and the Italian Renaissance began in the 1300s. Of course the printing press was important but it could not explain the prior 400 years of growth the way the rediscovery of Hellenistic thought could (which we seem to agree was happening during that time period). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I also think you are correct that the \&quot;mathematical\&quot; model of progress in my head sounds quite different from yours. I would hold that where something like the empirical philosophy of Aristotle is widely understood and shared by the ruling class then you&#039;re likely to see a kind of phase shift or cultural flowering, not a slow and steady exponential build. I think you can see this even in our era by societies that have adopted the idea of free markets. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And again I would point out that (unless my college lied to me) the Macedonian successor states that resulted from the breakup of Alexander&#039;s empire derived their ruling philosophy from Persia, not the Greek City states. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How someone can read all the thought that went into the idea of the trinity and not conclude that early Christianity was almost like some kind of thought parasite is beyond me! But I think we&#039;re just going to disagree.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398153]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397359,160398153]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397141,160397359,160398153]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396822,160396818,160397141,160397359,160398153]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396742,160396822,160396818,160397141,160397359,160398153]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396696,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;FG&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:00:22&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Curious, do you have a source for this?

Arabic philosophy and mathematics were at least as good as European, the Muqqaddimah is arguably as good as anything written at the same time in the Christian world. Chinese bureaucracy and state capacity is light years ahead of anywhere in the Christian world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;By 1650, that&#039;s totally wrong - France, Spain, England, etc. are clearly way ahead of the rest of the world.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Isn&#039;t the completely obvious answer that starting in 1492, by an accident of geography, the Christian nations gained access to an entire additional continent worth of resources? &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All the cool European innovations in the 1500-1700 period were inevitably funded by ludicrously wealth noble sponsors who had made gargantuan amounts of wealth through \&quot;new world\&quot; trade and resource exploitation. All those palaces and whatnot were built with that money, all the war-fighting machines were paid for with gold and spices extracted from the colonies. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The wealth effects of adding all of the Americas to your economy, in the span of like 100 years, should boggle the mind and explain anything we&#039;re wondering about in that time frame.

And I defy anyone to tell me how the Spanish are geographically positioned in some fortuitous manner to exploit the Philippines (e.g. one of the larger sources of Spanish \&quot;New World\&quot; revenue) or how Portugal had better geography to dominate Malacca than the Ottomans, the Persians, or the Mughals. Then, of course, we have the Dutch who managed to take South Africa and Indonesia that are about as far as it is possible to get from the Netherlands via oceanic routes. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because ultimately nothing stopped the Chinese or the Japanese from running the Manila Galleons in reverse except their lack of will to do so, technological inferiority, and oppressive political systems. Nothing prevented the Ottomans from using their holdings on the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea to dominate the Indian Ocean and drive out the Portuguese except for the fact that they lost every major naval engagement when operating 10 times closer to their ports than the enemy. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;End of the day the Europeans were willing to go because more of the sort who might sign on for a voyage had the ambition to get rich. The powers that be supported missionary activities to the furthest corners of the earth, and nobody had the authority to just up and abandon the coast. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because if we are talking about the first 100 years (i.e. to 1592) about a third of Spain&#039;s New World haul was running on the Acapulco - Manila run (5,000,000 pesos compared to 11,000,000 running Havana - Spain with another 1,500,000 going from Spain to Asia direct). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;End of the day, the winners of the New World, and the Old were not magically well positioned. They seized opportunities that fell to them by dint of technology, religious purpose, and superior military performance. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And when major new conquests were undertaken by alternative powers (e.g. when Judar Pasha took over the highly productive gold mines in Mali), they amounted to no increased productivity, limited economic expansion, and no discernable general convergence.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160396812,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;OldCurmudgeon&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 11:27:30&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;starting in 1492, by an accident of geography, the Christian nations gained access to an entire additional continent worth of resources?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;How did they manage that?

Places that didn&#039;t build international empires like the Nordic and Germanic countries basically did fine. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The New World did provide some quick opportunities for generating income via tobacco planting, fur trading, and cod fishing. But, the New World also imposed costs. The costs of having to settle an enormous and lightly populated pair of continents as well as the military conflicts for a \&quot;right\&quot; to those new lands.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396720,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Andrew&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 09:08:32&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I don&#039;t think it does a good job explaining the differences between England and Portugal, but I do think it helps a lot to explain the differences between Europe and the rest of the world. Like when I read about the Royal Society, for example, the striking thing about it is the insane amount of leisure time and money that underpins all those experiments. The massive step changes in European art were more or less entirely funded by wealthy patrons whose money can be traced to the \&quot;new world\&quot;.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397042,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;M&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 15:15:13&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:4,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;\&quot;The massive step changes in European art were more or less entirely funded by wealthy patrons whose money can be traced to the \&quot;new world\&quot;.\&quot;&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Florentines?

The landowners there were far wealthier and had far more time for leisure pursuits. There is a reason that opium was so debilitating to China - the elite class had massive funds and plenty of ways to sit around appreciating poetry (and that was more fun while high). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Go back to Rome and you will see that Crassus and the rest of the Senatorial class were rich beyond the wildest dreams of any Royal Society member. The size and scope of the Roman estates were massively greater and we have letters after the fall of Rome that the nobility literally looked around at their country being dismembered piecemeal and said \&quot;Eh, let&#039;s enjoy the good life\&quot; and then lived off their wealth for generations. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Need we go on with the Harems of the near east or the insanely expensive pageants of the far? &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There have always been wealthy patrons. What is unique about Europe is that:&lt;br \/&gt;\n1. New money was not instantly converted into land and \&quot;old money\&quot;&lt;br \/&gt;\n2. It was much more wildly spread than other places.&lt;br \/&gt;\n3. The wealthy patrons continued to work. They might be bankers or colonial proprietors but they rarely retired to the estates to do nothing.&lt;br \/&gt;\n4. The wealth was not fully consumed in a single generation. A highly fecund lord might have a half-dozen kids to set up in the Church, the army, and at court. In contrast, in polygamous societies there could easily be fifty. 8% of men within the borders of the old Mongol empire lineal y-chromosome descendants of Genghis Khan and he is not the only one. Even with rather extensive amounts of rape and bastardry, the official harems of the elites in the rest of the world consumed orders of magnitude more resources than the leisured elites of England. And worse, when it came time to inherit it was far harder to find slots for all the sons of the powerful. Which is one of the rather common signs of impending civil war and massive destruction. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;England was undoubtedly blessed with a large idle class that got hooked on science. But elite idleness is the norm and the resources needed to maintain England&#039;s leisure class was massively less in both absolute and relative terms than what the Mongols, Persians, or Ottomans ended up needing.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397042,160396857]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396720,160397042,160396857]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396709,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Stan Sitwell&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:38:57&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I think that&#039;s an oversimplification, because the European and slave populations of the Americas remained fairly low in comparison to Europe until after 1700, and most of those people were just farming, which isn&#039;t really \&quot;adding a continent&#039;s worth of resources\&quot; to Europe&#039;s balance sheet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396718,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Andrew&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 08:59:11&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Price_revolution&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Staggering monetary stimulus from looting the Aztecs...&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396734,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Stan Sitwell&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:15,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:15,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:15,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 10:06:50&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:4,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Nowadays we call that &#039;inflation.&#039; They thought they were importing wealth; what they were really importing was currency.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396734]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396718,160396734]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160396925,160396907,160396812,160396977,160396717,160396720,160397042,160396857,160396709,160396718,160396734]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396690,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Strick&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:12,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:12,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:12,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 07:14:14&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I love the story that the printing press, which was only a minor innovation on presses and paper production invented in the East, caught on and helped revolutionize Europe because of the Roman alphabet.

Carolingian minuscule did that. Minuscule also greatly expanded the reach of reading and writing which provided a market for the pamphlets (as printing Bibles or court documents had nowhere near enough demand to sustain the nascent industry while printing mass Lutheran pamphlets did ... because the preceding centuries had seen to a dramatic increase in the ability of middle classes to read and to read fluently). &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And that, of course, overlooks the metallurgical advances that allowed for moveable type via the durability and precision possible with lead-tin-antimony type. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And none of this was accidental. There was better metallurgy because the late Middle Ages had embraced some degree of experimentalism unheard of ever before. This in turn derived from the increasing literacy of the time which goes back to things like Charlemagne deciding that good religion needed better education and Alcuin standardizing minuscule among the learned (leading to both more efficient text production and text comprehension). Both of these, in turn can be traced back yet further to the needs of a Christian society to maintain dogma and belief. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Printing, after all, was developed many times. But it faced a lack of demand sufficient to make it outcompete the initially superior penmanship of the scribes. Woodcuts were too time intensive and metal plates too quickly blurred and became illegible. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But there were exceedingly few dramatic lucky breaks in technological progression. Europe had been at the forefront of metallurgy for quite some time (due to the need to cast bells and manufacture plate armor) so it is not surprising that they succeeded where others failed.

If someone says the decline of feudalism lead to the rise of modern democracy you can compare some input variable(how long serfdom lasted in a place or the average number of serfs there) to your output variable(score on a modern democracy index). Throw in some control variables and get your R\u00b2. Now you \&quot;know\&quot; what percent of the variance in the strength of democracy relates to feudalism.

This, of course, is consistent with science and liberalism emerging in the Catholic world, but not in the Eastern or Oriental Orthodox empires . . . but it doesn&#039;t give much evidence for Christianity &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;\/i&gt; being particularly valuable, as opposed to the healthiest of the various host memplexes for Aristotlean inquiry (Averroist Islam and post-Maimonides Rabbinical Judaism being crushed as heresy and restricted to an oppressed minority, respectively).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160396802,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sure&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 11:20:19&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Compared to what?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Zera Yocab manages many of the same liberal theories as Locke from an Oriental Orthodox perspective. Pretty much all of the ingredients were actually present ... and then the court devolved into a massive struggle between the Oromos (largely Muslim) and the Ahmari (largely Oriental Orthodox) with some degree of foreign support for the latter. This ethno-religious splintering was the nadir of Oriental Orthodox influence and once unity was restored under Tewodros II and Menelik II, Ethiopia began a rapid modernization and was the strongest polity in Africa throughout the 19th century.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Russia had the problem that up until ~1770 the most productive regions were subject to regular, hostile slaving expeditions from the Crimeans. In any event, the Petrine Reforms once again adopted a deeply Orthodox mindset to the basics of Christianity, and would have gone further, per the actual opinions of the reformers, had Peter not needed to buy off the nobility and generate tax revenue with serfdom restrictions.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Byzantium was easily the most technologically advanced power in the Middle Ages. As with Ethiopia and Russia, there was again a drastic burden placed upon the populace due to incessant raiding, first from barbarians over the river, then the Persians, and then the Islamic Turks.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Was Protestantism more effective than Christianity in general? Quite likely. Universal public education and literacy were part and parcel of a creed that required everyone to read the holy book themselves. But pretty much all of the extant historical Christian polities were more liberal than their contemporaries and grew more so the more Christian they became (and less so the more they had to deal with powerful non-Christian forces).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397088,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;The Lunatic&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 16:47:16&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Buuuuut there were wars\&quot; is an utterly lame excuse. &lt;i&gt;Everywhere&lt;\/i&gt; had wars.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The Petrine Reforms were just one of many, many failed attempts by backward societies over the last four centuries to attempt to import ideas from the the advanced ones, failing for the usual reason (local cultural autoimmune rejection). Indeed, the multiple and repeat failures of Orthodox Christendom to catch up to the West (when your &lt;i&gt;best&lt;\/i&gt; example of an advanced country is Greece, you just need to concede failure) is a clear indicator that \&quot;Christianity\&quot; is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;\/i&gt; good enough.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are exactly two areas of the modern world where developed societies exist, and those are 1) the lands of Latin Christendom and their settler states, and 2) the lands ruled for more than a generation by the Empire of Japan. The latter lands (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan) are, in fact, the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;\/i&gt; evidence that societies that aren&#039;t lineal descendants of Latin Christendom &lt;i&gt;can&lt;\/i&gt; be something other than perpetually backward (which makes them quite interesting).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And no, there is &lt;i&gt;no&lt;\/i&gt; particular advantage to &lt;i&gt;Protestantism&lt;\/i&gt; within Western Christianity. France is not Protestant. Italy is not Protestant. The Rhineland is not Protestant. Bavaria is not Protestant. Austria is not Protestant. Belgium is not Protestant.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397384,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Sure&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-19 11:59:02&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;More there were not wars. Mustering armies, arming them with the most effective weapons, and then fighting had some positive benefits for growing societal capacity, technology diffusion, and broad political emancipation. Slave raiding has none of these. Be it the Romans of the 5th century, the Russians of the 16th, or the Chinese from any number of dynasties we see slave riding being a force for pulling the state apart as armies must be forward billeted, with limited utility for force multiplication, aggrieved hinterlands who might just open the gates to secure a better deal for themselves. Yes, Southern Europe was raided by the Barbary Corsairs, but the scale was an order of magnitude less than passed through Crimea alone. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In the West (and Japan and southern Persia and Egypt) slave raiding was less than a rounding error in the birthrate. Of all the world&#039;s great empires until 1750, all them were either brought down by a bunch of jumped-up slave raiders (like the Mongols, the Huns, the Crimeans, the Turks) or they were the jumped-up slave raiders. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;From 1877 to 1939 Romania beat all of its Latinate neighbors in GDP\/capita growth. In spite of starting from a wildly lower base it entered WWII with ~70% of Polish GDP\/Capita and ~60% of Hungarian GDP\/capita and roughly on par with that of the Slovaks. If we want to talk about culturally, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and its successor the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was the most liberal place in history. It had the greatest respect for personal rights accorded for hundreds of years and did so with explicit recognition of the Orthodox as equal partners and many holding high office.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan were all areas of intense Protestant Christian activity. I believe the majority of post-war Japanese prime ministers have been protestant Christians while South Korea and Taiwan both have extensive overrepresentation of Presbyterians in their governments. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Catholic endorsement of mass education at Trent was directly tied to the successes of Protestantism with its emphasis on education and universal literacy. Shockingly, France (where perhaps 20% of the population were Huguenots prior to repression), Belgian (where the famous Protestant Belgic confession was written in the sixteenth century prior to repression), the Rhinelind (where the Archbishop of Cologne converted to Protestantism and sparked a war to prevent it), Bavaria (where the state found reason to found the Jesuit College of Ingolstadt specifically to counter the Reformers), and Austria (where just under 50% of the population went Protestant). The Reformation sparked a new level of education and scientific inquiry not just among the Protestants, but also among the frontline Catholic states. Almost as though the Catholics, by necessity, were forced to compete via the Jesuits and other educational endeavors. Almost as though numerous Protestant ideas (like those surrounding interest) were retained even after return to Catholicism.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160397384]},{&quot;id&quot;:160396982,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Aimi San Miguel&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-18 13:40:52&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Zera Yocab reeks of being a pious forgery (like countless other texts throughout the ages).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;His supposed enlightenment theories (suspiciously so) exist only in a &#039;translation&#039; centuries later by an Italian and the ostensible original manuscript immediately lost, and there are zero independent attestations to what should have been incredibly inflammatory and illegal philosophical writings, which appear to have had an immaculate conception.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;None of this is mentioned by Yocab enthusiasts who are thrilled by how very Enlightenment and ahead of its time this philosophizing by a Black man outside Europe was, and when challenged, like Dag Herbj\u00f8rnsrud https:\/\/aeon.co\/essays\/yacob-and-amo-africas-precursors-to-locke-hume-and-kant?comments=true , admit that it was thought to be a forgery almost immediately and that was the consensus for half a century - but don&#039;t worry, there&#039;s good reasons to not think so, see some unspecified article in another language and also we have a book upcoming someday (4 years later, still unpublished)!

Further the rulers and religious authorities in Islamic realms ca 1000 were often in various states of political conflict.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As for the importance of the investiture contest, the term prince-bishop is useful to know. \&quot;Bishops had been involved in the government of the Frankish realm and subsequent Carolingian Empire frequently as the clerical member of a duo of envoys styled Missus dominicus, but that was an individual mandate, not attached to the see. Prince-bishoprics were most common in the feudally fragmented Holy Roman Empire, where many were formally awarded the rank of an Imperial Prince Reichsf\u00fcrst, granting them the immediate power over a certain territory and a representation in the Imperial Diet (Reichstag).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The stem duchies of the German kingdom inside the Empire had strong and powerful dukes (originally, war-rulers), always looking out more for their duchy&#039;s \&quot;national interest\&quot; than for the Empire&#039;s. In turn the first Ottonian (Saxon) king Henry the Fowler and more so his son, Emperor Otto I, intended to weaken the power of the dukes by granting loyal bishops Imperial lands and vest them with regalia privileges. Unlike dukes they could not pass hereditary titles and lands to any descendants. Instead the Emperors reserved the implementation of the bishops of their proprietary church for themselves, defying the fact that according to canon law they were part of the transnational Catholic Church. This met with increasing opposition by the Popes, culminating in the fierce Investiture Controversy of 1076. Nevertheless, the Emperors continued to grant major territories to the most important (arch)bishops. The immediate territory attached to the episcopal see then became a prince-diocese or bishopric (F\u00fcrstbistum).[1] The German term Hochstift was often used to denote the form of secular authority held by bishops ruling a prince-bishopric with Erzstift being used for prince-archbishoprics.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Emperor Charles IV by the Golden Bull of 1356 confirmed the privileged status of the Prince-Archbishoprics of Mainz, Cologne and Trier as members of the electoral college.
