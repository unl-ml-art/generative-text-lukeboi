Among other things, the source is some unknown \&quot;International Charity Fund\&quot; for Belarus, which is NGO speech for pro regime-change outfit. Also, not even in the much poorer Ukraine do villagers depend on chopping firewood to heat their homes. Most significantly, no one in Russia or Belarus gives a damn anymore about covid, least of all young, fit, and vaxxed soldiers.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398447,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Peter Akuleyev&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-21 11:44:08&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;People in much richer New Hampshire chop firewood to heat their homes.  Rural Belarus is very much dependent on burning lumber.  The other element that makes the thread seem plausible to me is the bias against non-Slavic troops.  Doubtful a Westerner would pick up on and reinforce the typical Slavic stereotype that Central Asians and dark people from the Caucuses like to rape white women, especially not an NGO type.   The COVID element is probably exaggerated - but most of the soldiers are certainly not vaxxed and not as fit as you imagine.  They may also just be suffering from normal pneumonia from being exposed to cold damp weather for weeks on end.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398447]},{&quot;id&quot;:160398097,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;mkt42&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 18:22:20&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;6. Viviana Zelizer on how money can bring us closer (NYT).\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;One of the jokes about libertarianism is how its answer to everything is the free market.  Feeling lonely?  Buy a few friends.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Jokes aside though, the essay makes sense.

If we&#039;re wise, we&#039;ll keep them.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160398094,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;mkt42&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:6,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:6,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:6,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 18:12:55&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;7. Update on tokamak plasmas.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Like the self-driving cars that were supposed to be just two years away, eight years ago, practical fusion energy is supposed to be just a dozen years away, and has been for decades.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But though this research combines two of the most notorious vaporware technologies, AI and fusion energy, it does seem like a very good idea.  When\/if fusion energy every does become economically feasible, one would have to think that AI will be involved.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398580,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Bill Benzon&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-21 14:16:04&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;From the article:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A radically new approach to controller design is made possible by using reinforcement learning (RL) to generate non-linear feedback controllers. The RL approach, already used successfully in several challenging applications in other domains11,12,13, enables intuitive setting of performance objectives, shifting the focus towards what should be achieved, rather than how. Furthermore, RL greatly simplifies the control system. A single computationally inexpensive controller replaces the nested control architecture, and an internalized state reconstruction removes the requirement for independent equilibrium reconstruction.&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398580]},{&quot;id&quot;:160398068,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Calvin Hobbes&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:9,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:9,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:9,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 17:30:01&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;So which of Biden\u2019s  Fed nominees is the worst?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Sarah Bloom Raskin, who wants to use the Fed to lean on banks in a way that will supposedly fight climate change?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Or Lisa Cook, whose most well-known paper is possibly one of the worst papers in the entire Economics literature?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Half-Cooked Data&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;https:\/\/www.takimag.com\/article\/half-cooked-data\/&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398071,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Calvin Hobbes&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 17:33:45&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Here\u2019s a challenge.

But, her completely boring finding that blacks in the South were less likely to earn patents than blacks in the North is valid, so therefore her purported qualifications to be Federal Reserve Governor should not be questioned.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398379,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Calvin Hobbes&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:1,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-21 10:10:27&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Harald Uhlig\u2019s objection to Cook\u2019s nomination is not that her famous paper is garbage.

A being is a thing.  Is finite.  God is not finite.  God is being itself.  &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Some study physics, or the stars, or biology... and see order, that there are things we can understand and document.  It, for them, points to God.  The same experience guides others away from belief.

With phones, text messaging, email, and Zoom, there are so many ways for friends to keep in touch nowadays. When you think about how new and unprecedented this is in human history, it&#039;s actually kind of mind-blowing. In this age of abundance of communication technology, how can you NOT make the effort to keep in touch?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Pre-commitment strategies likely are the answer. Set up a pre-determined time to talk (first Tuesday night of every month at 8 p.m. GMT). Plan your weekly trip to the grocery store close to your favorite park for a walk together. Bring the family over for Super Bowl every year.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Stop letting your job, your spouse, your kids, or your chores to an excuse. If you care enough about someone, make the time to spend with them. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;When I consider the people I know with the greatest talent for friendship, I realize that they do just this.

D. McClay, an essayist and critic, in Lapham\u2019s Quarterly last spring. \u201cBut when friendship becomes the plot, then the only story to tell is about how the friendship ended.\u201d&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I have friends who are neurotic and deeply interested in how relationships work. I also have friends who are essentially happy-go-lucky and have barely any interest in any kind of theory of relationships. I like them all, but it&#039;s not hard for me to see who two neurotic people (like the Rebecca and Elisa mentioned in that article) would have a hard time forming a lasting friendship. A lot of things just don&#039;t benefit from being endlessly scrutinized, and friendship is one of them.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398111,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;mkt42&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 18:52:56&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Yes; to paraphrase Tolstoy:&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Happy friendships are all alike; every unhappy friendship is unhappy in its own way.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The unhappy ones are the ones with dramatic plots, that are worth writing about.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Your observation about friendships between two neurotic people sounds plausible.  They make their friendship part of the plot, to the detriment of the friendship.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The essay didn&#039;t address that.  It did address envy, with some very good observations and drawing upon Kahneman and Tversky (not their research, but the dramatic story of the strained friendship).  An aside:  as an economist I always thought of them as KahnemanAndTversky, I didn&#039;t differentiate between them the way that scholars in their field apparently did. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The takeaway is \&quot;don&#039;t be envious\&quot; but that is hard to do.  The essay does make the interesting observation that unlike the other seven deadly sins, there&#039;s no upside to envy, no temptation  to do it because it feels good.  It&#039;s just bad, period.  The essay cites Adam Smith in saying that wise people try not to provoke envy in others, i.e. don&#039;t parade your accomplishments; that&#039;s good advice but seems more characteristic of Asian cultures than Western ones.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But I think the essay gets it right by giving the biggest spotlight to what&#039;s probably the largest factor in friendships ending:  simple neglect.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398111]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397950,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Rick G&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 13:43:22&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;#3 is very exciting.

If you&#039;re looking to religion for explanations of the outside world, then you&#039;ve already gotten off on the wrong foot. Traditional religions have zero to do with explaining the outside world. How could they? They were born in a time that predated man&#039;s fixation on the outside world. Instead, they have everything to do with discussing the subjective experience of the world inside your head and how it relates to your social world--both of which existed in full force at the time of their founding. They are narrative-based precursors to phenomenology and sociology. Nothing more. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As a result, intellectual paths like the one Hanson describes sound peculiar. They start at a point that misstates what religion is and end up at a point of rejecting religion.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Of course, religious people often make wild claims about the outside world, using religion to justify them. With religion as with any system of thought, however, you want to separate the claims of adherents from the underlying thought.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398073,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;MacDonald&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:5,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:6,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:7,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 17:34:56&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Traditional religions have zero to do with explaining the outside world.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Which religion are you part of that doesn&#039;t explain the creation of the world? Were we not told that weather and fertility of the crops was caused by favor\/disfavor with the gods? Every religion has a pat story for what we see in the material world and there is nothing wrong with saying that they have it wrong and that science is better at explaining these things than the old ways. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I feel like discussing religion on MR is a strange act of denying the obvious and more similar to a NY Times comment section that ignores certain realities.

To my mind, that means viewing religion dispassionately and trying not to fall for self-congratulatory atheistic traps (feeling self-congratulatory looks a lot like the the subjective consciousness focus of a religion). It also includes taking religion seriously enough to see if it offers any nuggets, as well as knowing that religious traditions had some role in shaping the mind of every person on the planet.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;},{&quot;id&quot;:160398087,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Roland&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 17:58:23&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;If you&#039;re limited to phenomenology, as the pre-naturalists generally were, then your world is, generally, the experience of subjective consciousness, not the physical earth, sun, human body, and so on.

The rise of naturalistic philosophies followed. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Feeling threatened by the naturalist turn, religious people (not religion itself) then turned, foolishly, to \&quot;explaining\&quot; the outside world with narratives that had survived because of their ability to create context and meaning to subjective experience.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398092,160398087]}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398073,160398092,160398087]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397946,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;BC&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:14,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:14,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:14,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 13:37:39&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:0,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;#1) I thought Robin Hanson finds it plausible, if not likely, that we are living in a computer simulation.  If so, after reading his post, I&#039;m still not sure why he finds it likely (?) that we could be living in a simulation created by mortals but not a simulation created by a supreme being?&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I find questions about whether God exists off the mark.  Instead, I think it&#039;s more salient to distinguish between falsifiable claims and unfalsifiable ones.  Falsifiable claims like, \&quot;Prayer reduces the probability of airplanes crashing,\&quot; fall within the domain of science.  Unfalsifiable claims like, \&quot;God answers our prayers in ways that could be mysterious to us and that we may not fully understand at first, if ever,\&quot; fall outside the domain of, and hence cannot be rejected by, science.  By definition, faith is the acceptance (or rejection) of claims that are unfalsifiable and unprovable.  That&#039;s probably the real reason why other physicists reach different conclusions from Hanson about the existence of God.  One could even view science as the study of falsifiable claims about how a God-created universe (or simulation) operates.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;To be clear, regardless of one&#039;s faith with respect to unfalsifiable claims,  it&#039;s imperative to not allow such faith to impede one&#039;s scientific judgement with respect to falsifiable claims.  Even if one accepts on faith that we are living in a simulation, science has delivered much knowledge about constraints on what can and can&#039;t happen within that simulation.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398571,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;y81&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-21 14:08:02&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;I had forgotten about that particular Hansonianism.

I Googled around and looked at various tables like this one (https:\/\/smartasset.com\/taxes\/most-charitable-states-in-america-2017) that suggest no meaningful difference between red and blue states in time or money donated (after accounting for the fact that red states are generally poorer).&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398042,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;PHinton&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:3,&quot;vote_count&quot;:5,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 17:06:16&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt; Where are you getting this from? &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The most interesting book on the subject is \&quot;Who Really Cares\&quot; by Arthur Brooks.  Time is a huge donation made by folks. The average time donated oer household is about 46 hours per year, with 18% of that going to religion, 13% going to youth, and 3% going to the poor.  But half of families do no volunteering at all. The top 20% of families donate in excess of 300 hours a year. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There are 75M families that never give any money. And 130M that donate zero time. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;An important point from the book: Ideology does not drive charity differences. But instead, it&#039;s the things that tend to follow political beliefs that determine if you are generous or not. On the surface, liberals are more likely to volunteer than conservatives, and conservatives are more likely to donate money. When you look at dollar amounts, though, conservative households give 30% more money to charity than liberal households. All this while the liberal households earned 6% more. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As an example from the book: Families in San Francisco give almost exactly the same amount each year to charity as families in South Dakota: about $1300.  However, your San Fran family has 78% more income. The family in south dakota averages $45K, the family in San Fran $81K.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lots of fascinating points in the book, all sourced.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398135,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;steve&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:1,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 20:05:03&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;You go to church? I do. As has been documented elsewhere a larger percentage of donations by conservatives goes to their churches, which would include personal time donations. That would include stuff like the gym that our mega church built when I was younger and the time donated by church members so that we could run the gym for both the adults and kids. This is technically a donation to charity but it is really tax deductible donations to fund activities that the church wanted to do that arent very related to religion or faith. When you look at donations that do not have direct financial benefit to the one donating, maybe something like a soup kitchen, differences go away. &lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;}],&quot;childrenIDs&quot;:[160398135]},{&quot;id&quot;:160397964,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;RW Force&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:2,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:2,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:2,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 14:39:08&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;73% of US charitable giving goes to religious organizations.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397988,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;FG&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:0,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:0,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:0,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 15:45:29&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:3,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Huh, I didn&#039;t know this.

The more one believes that climate change is an urgent problem that Congress has been \&quot;obstructed\&quot; from properly addressing, the more credible the accusations that Raskin will implement climate policy via the Fed.  If one doesn&#039;t find such a possibility credible, then one must not think Raskin&#039;s views on climate and the Fed make much sense.  If one does find those views sensible, then why wouldn&#039;t one believe that she would pursue them if given the opportunity?  The view that well, yes, Raskin is absolutely right that Congress has obstructed necessary climate reforms and the Fed can fill that vacuum but, no, she won&#039;t actually pursue that as Fed vice chair for supervision is completely uncredible.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397967,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Cancelled for wongthink&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-1,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:1,&quot;downboops&quot;:2,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 14:50:55&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;Most of the issues involving climate change are actually sprawl (Houston and New Orleans and Charleston) and then people living in huge numbers in two regions that were thought uninhabitable year round 150 years ago\u2014South Florida and Southern California.

One of the things you learn as a part of a Catholic education is that the books in the Bible were written by humans, often humans generations removed from biblical events. You learn that the Church then chose which books to compile into the Bible and made many editorial decisions along the way. The Church itself predates the Bible, the Quran, etc. and traces its roots to the disciples and many church traditions don\u2019t come from the Bible, but rather the early church. Knowing Church tradition was written by and shaped by men, it isn\u2019t a surprise that the authors of sacred texts used their own context, shaped by their time, to interpret divine events. Given Christianity is more concerned with interpersonal interaction, it isn\u2019t a surprise that God didn\u2019t talk science.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160397976,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;EdR&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:-3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:4,&quot;downboops&quot;:7,&quot;vote_count&quot;:11,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 15:10:25&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:2,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;The Old Testament has a lot of good stuff in there which, if followed, leads to a good life.

Why couldn&#039;t it go the other direction? The existence of these fossils would certainly not be inconsistent with a Hindu conception of de-progressing cyclical ages.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And the Creation story in Genesis has been understood symbolically and allegorically for thousands of years.&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What&#039;s lacking most of all when people nowadays approach these matters is what Keats called \&quot;Negative Capability\&quot;: \&quot;it struck me what quality went to form a Man of Achievement, especially in Literature, and which Shakespeare possessed so enormously - I mean Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason.\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&quot;,&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;id&quot;:160398165,&quot;author&quot;:&quot;Ricardo&quot;,&quot;vote_total&quot;:3,&quot;user_vote&quot;:null,&quot;updoots&quot;:3,&quot;downboops&quot;:0,&quot;vote_count&quot;:3,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;2022-02-20 22:01:32&quot;,&quot;depth&quot;:4,&quot;content&quot;:&quot;&lt;p&gt;\&quot;Finding several fossils that appear as an intermediate stage between ape and human doesn&#039;t necessarily posit linear evolution\&quot;&lt;\/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is a hypothesis and, at the time Darwin made it, there were no intermediate fossils at all.
