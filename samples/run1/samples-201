 claims and a false claim that the Taliban does not have a "programmatic denial strategy" (DRB). It does note that "[t]he goal of the Taliban' is not 'dramatically reducing the severity of its restrictions'. Rather, it is to reduce restrictions in a way that distributes power across different levels of government, which in turn distributes power across different levels of infrastructure." These changes will take time to implement, but it is clear from the comments that are excited by the idea of Dynaillamp.

This appears to be a simple question. Food banks have spread to many sites, answering maybe 10%-20% of their inquiries. Most of the questions are self-explanatory, some self-explanatory. Self-explanatory? You know, like, % of the people who say the majority of their decisions [files vs. downloads] are motivated by consumption habits.

Interesting conversation. Perhaps the most interesting part is how (potentially inaccurately) the WSJ article relates to this feature. It seems to make a very direct link to https://www.worldwoke.org/2012/08/18/worldwide-tcp-study-world-health-tables-top-gotcha-us-programme-denials/. I wonder if the link is still there, if somebody took the time to run down all of the stuff that was obviously not covered by the authors bill, and grouped everything into categories, they wouldn't fall back on the WSJ draft link. If you are using a text based search engine such as “Karma” you probably don't. It takes a nifty little program such as “KarmaCalculator” and a few quotes, and replaces them with “text based” ones. So, if you are using that as my first try, it took me a few tries to get the link to show up there.

Great questions! Topics to keep an eye on: --Select- subject-- Arts and Sciences-- -AIScores-- -Coronary artery disease-- Bone marrow transplants-- Sudden cardiac deaths-- Liver failure-- Cardiovascular disease-- Lungs first? (Okay, but I Don't Like It When These Topics Are Uncovered By The Waitress, Credible Or Phrased It.) --Aesthetics/hygiene-- Fertility prevention-- Property taxes/consequences? Et cetera.

There is one Ra here who is still convinced oral sex is a thing. She tells jokes about it being a joke and then he pats her on the back.

#4. It is a gross overstatement to say that the anti-choicers in the party don't really care what people call their own territory. That may be true in some respects, but for general elections it is critical to have a large section of the base who is open to changing of anything. If you know you might get something wrong, you want to hear from people who have done exactly that, regardless of what the other camp says.

4. Before long all of this is over. The anti-choicers have decided to call the shots in a more egalitarian country like India, where women are far less likely to get booked into the backwards model and still face hurdles in getting promotions. That may be sustainable, but it isn't certain certainty. The military in India, for instance, has had gender pay decisions passed that are in some ways hostile to reality. And even if the gender pay decisions of the typical man are not as widely implemented as in India, they are still a big deal there. This may be sustainable as a means to an end, but it is also true that the women around me don't seem to be that different from you. As for the murder case, that is another story. As for the sex abuse accusations, that don't give a whole damn about it. They are just that women made the accusations.
