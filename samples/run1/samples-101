 lower, and this has negative consequences for downstream health. For instance, the higher the salt content, the lower the risk of infection relative to plant and animal sources, as well as the slower the water loss, resulting in slower evaporation. Regarding mangrove scrub, he seems to have focused on the things that had less to do with him and agriculture: invertebrates; invertebrates; invertebrates; invertebrates; invertebrates; invertebrates; invertebrates. Given the relatively low density of the bacteria in the water, invertebrates and mangrove scrub were probably not worth the risk of infection.

Is this the first time Amazon forest fires have killed more people?

My favorite sentence was 'the deaths caused largely economic and social damage'

"And yet..." I believe this is a very good conversation starter. But the thing about economics -- and liberal psychology -- is you get started talking, and you move on to the next part -- perhaps the best part -- and you find another way to talk -- by moving beyond "the deaths caused mostly economic and social damage" -- and instead moving onto "how people can live longer, in a more prosperous world without killing each other". --and then you start pivoting your thinking towards "how people could live better, more happily without doing so" -- and you end up with a conversation starter that is really just trying to decide between two options: 1) It is the long term beneficial to avoid doing harm to each other that is beneficial for the long term. 2) It is the long term beneficial to avoid doing harm to any other person. 3) It is the long term detrimental to society overall to do so. And so on. -- Ezra Klein

I wonder if the reason so many people have reverted to Thomassonism is because they see a rhetorical error vs. a moralism - both of which are important in making moral arguments vs. inducing one in the first place

I believe this is a very good conversation starter. The reason why liberalism tends to exhaust itself with long lists of ills is because it completely forgotten about the other ills. So ironically, the reason why liberals have reverted to anti-crisis economics is because of this. The problem with anti-crisis economics is that it focuses heavily on losses rather than gains. Instead of tracking losses as losses (which it does at least now), the Macroeconomists just add in losses (which they did at the beginning) and then work out what those losses are. When they're able to correct for misallocations of losses (which they did at the beginning), the momentum will then be shifted to the consumption sectors where wearer (cost-benefit analysis) will find more efficient ways of measuring losses.

The one that makes my day. The one that makes my job easier. The One that can be trusted. When I look at them I see someone who is probably not going to run a successful business again. They seem like they will never be. I think this may be because they have not had the chance to mature. They appear to have mostly faded as a result of a generation of talented people who were probably never meant to develop into successful businesses. I think these are the people who actually matter. They may be good people with great ideas, but not great prospects for success. They may be great people just waiting to be convinced they can turn things around. Maybe they are just boring, boring people who don't really care about anything beyond the silly ideas they entertain. They may be bright and engaging and would benefit from a lot of exposure if they got the chance. But they may not be very bright. The best way to tell this is that they are not really anyone to them. Really, really not anyone at all. A generation of brilliant people has mostly failed because of failures of these people's ideas. That's all well and good for them, but they don't really care about anything beyond their silly ideas. What bothers them is that they have all failed because they either don't care about anything beyond their silly ideas or they will continue to be brilliant because they do care about nothing but silly ideas. That's the worst waste of talent. A generation of brilliantly talented people does not really matter. They just don't care about anything beyond their silly ideas. That's the only waste of talent.

I would highly doubt that Jared Cowen is studying economics as an undergraduate. In other words, he's probably an undergraduate who thinks highly of various approaches to the same problem. Cowen could be an undergraduate who thinks highly of Michael Gerson or a student at the University of Chicago. Or he could be an undergraduate who thinks highly of John Maynard Keynes, whose insights were valuable but no less foolish in the 1950s. In any event, Ezra,
