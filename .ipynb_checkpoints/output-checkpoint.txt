Quote from: Alex’s own article on the matter, it reads: “In this case, it was about the absence of a doubt: the author believed that Russia was behind the hacking, the absence was that Putin had "direct knowledge" of the activity, and that when the evidence was not overwhelming, the author would take the evidence to the Russian Foreign Ministry and demand an intelligence-gathering mission. Considering that the author was not a part of the hacking enterprise to begin with, and that knowledge is likely to be lost, the author might as well be a good Jew." Here is the relevant passage from the open access article: "As for the specificity of the author's inquiry, that of Harvard sociologist Francis S. Lukacs, who in December asked whether the Kremlin had directed a cyberattack, and whether it was a 'counterexample' to democratic reforms, or a 'chilling effect'' on democracy Francis S. Lukacs is a bestselling author of books on politics, religion, and philosophy. author “Lukacs asks whether the Kremlin is waging a 'counterexample' to democratic reforms, or a 'chilling effect''. Can anyone give me a counterexample? 4/ We are down to earth. ↓

David Ignatius offers something very similar to this: "counterrevolution" in the name of "progress" . It's a fancy way of saying "building a government of workers". It literally says "provide for the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the maintenance of the". I.e. make government more and more bureaucrat and ideological.

Judging from the blurb, the short article the Tyler students are using is fairly good: https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-teens-favor-glorifying-straight-ink/
A new comment:
Tyler: "Glorification is the New Jim. The Same Way It's the New Economy." Glorification of a specific group by its ability to generate income and then providing that income to their children. The process is similar for all industries, except leasing, and different for commercial real estate. See also old-school "producers" and "labourers".

The articleage is filling up with these kinds of discussions.

Probably has been open on this site for a while now. I don't really see how it can continue unless Tyler is actually serious about improving the quality of life for the kids and the general public. Since his firing, the GoFundMe page has been up more than 40% in less than two weeks. If this is the intention, he or others in the GoFundMe are in a state of denial because even if it's 51%-52.0%, the majority of people on the planet are in a state of denial now.
